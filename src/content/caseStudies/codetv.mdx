		[CodeTV](https://codetv.dev/) is the home of several TV series aimed at web developers, from developer stories, to live coding, to game shows. They needed a platform that could handle a complex data architecture while being performant enough to be an engaging streaming platform for subscribers.
	</div>
</div>

Tired of every live-streamed event feeling the same, Jason Lengstorf set out to create engaging video content for web developers. Jason's shows focus on original concepts and high production value to provide a TV-like alternative to yet another Zoom call, posted to YouTube. Astro allowed Jason to build an entire media platform that handled both his content and performance needs and "just worked" ... so that he could focus on creating original programming.

(probably graphic here)

## Challenges

When Jason Lengstorf found success with his television series "Learn with Jason," he realized that he wanted to produce more, and varied, video content: scripted shows with characters you invest in, and even game shows where web dev personalities face off head to head! But, that meant he needed to expand his brand and create an organized home for *all* his content. After trying "blog" solutions, then "social feed" solutions, Lengstorf realized, "I'm making TV. What does TV look like?" He noticed that established media streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, and Nebula all followed a consistent architecture with specific features.

CodeTV needed needed to make it easy for viewers to navigate a complex architecture of television series (comprised of seasons, which further contain episodes) and personalities (hosts, guests). Supporters need to be able to pay, log in for early/exclusive content & other benefits, and update their own account information. The platform also needed to track which shows subscribers had already watched and provide notifications for new shows available to watch.

CodeTV needed to do a lot, and do it reliably, so that Jason could spend his time creating content and not troubleshooting its delivery platform.

## Requirements

To achieve Jason's goals of being a full-fledged media platform, CodeTV needed a solution that was easy to integrate with a variety of services: content management system (CMS), authentication, e-commerce, video streaming, digital asset management, site search, as well as complex workflow automation connecting everything together.

With all of that going on, there was no room for bloat. CodeTV needed to be lightweight and performant. And, the code needed to be easy to organize and maintain. Astro's "opt in to complexity" model was exactly what Jason needed.

Jason had already chosen Sanity as his headless CMS to manage his complex data architecture. Astro's ability to integrate with any headless CMS gave Jason the confidence to know that Astro would have no trouble handling his data. But, could Astro be a full, subscription-based, video-on-demand streaming service provider?

## Solution and Implementation

Even with a complex data architecture (series, seasons, episodes, hosts, guests, bonus content, related resources), rendering fast, performant pages in Astro was no problem. 

Jason had started with a server rendered project, knowing that Astro would allow him to designate individual static pages as prerendered. Eventually Jason realized, much to his surprise, that he was prerendering almost every page. As dynamic as CodeTV feels, it delivers almost exactly the same content to every visitor. Astro's server islands allow CodeTV to prerender practically the entire site, deferring the loading of personalized dynamic content without blocking the rendering of an otherwise static page.

Incrementally, Jason added the necessary integrations to CodeTV to build out the streaming platform: Clerk for authentication, Stripe for payment processing, Mux video player for adaptive bit rate streaming. It turned out, everything was well within the bounds of what server islands and the server rendered pages could do. Subscriptions, user dashboard, custom subscriber content... whatever Jason threw at Astro, it "just worked."

Jason was even able to reuse a custom React Algolia component that had moved with him over the years, from one site to another, without needing to rebuild a site search solution, nor remember how he did it originally.

In order to maintain a website that was easy to use for both less experienced developers as well as folks that were not familiar with code, Thinkmill needed a solution that was simple.

<ImageFigure caption="Astro is extremely well documented and has a friendly community.">
	<BlogContentImage src={astroBenefits} />
</ImageFigure>

Simon Swiss, Developer Advocate at Thinkmill, strongly advocated for the team to use Astro because it was extremely well documented. Anyone that wanted to jump into the website could easily upskill themselves to start contributing. Non-senior developers could manage the site with only HTML and CSS while senior developers who favoured React could feel at home with the JSX syntax. Astro also came with highly desirable content features such as MDX support, syntax highlighting and pagination out of the box so Thinkmill did not have to build those features.

		choose Astro.”

</Blockquote>

The team was also not sure if they were going to stick with the solution they chose. This made it absolutely necessary for the solution to be flexible in case they needed to swap it out later on. Astro allowed Thinkmill to support their legacy MDX files straight out of the box. At the same time, if Thinkmill ever wanted to move to a headless CMS or even use an API, they could.

Astro ended up being such a simple and flexible tool that the team made it a permanent solution.

## Solution and Implementation

When asked what the two most advantageous things about Astro were, Simon cited strong documentation and ease of entry for non-senior engineers.

According to Simon, Astro was easy to explain to both sides. React engineers found Astro familiar because of the JSX syntax and it wasn’t that much of a reach for developers that only knew HTML and CSS. Astro felt like using HTML with JSX capabilities, which the entire team loved.

The team heavily leveraged Astro components in their site - treating it almost like a React project but without any of the complexity that React can bring. As soon as [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) released, Simon’s team started using them. Content collections even allowed Thinkmill to pair Astro with [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) - their content management tool - to make content collections editable in a GUI.

## Results

### Reduced Friction

Thinkmill went from needing a senior developer to make changes to the website to 4 non-senior design engineers actively managing the site today. In addition, close to 15 people have contributed to the source code of the Thinkmill website - designers and developers inclusive.

Prior to Astro, it was difficult for people to join the website project for several days due to the time needed to gain enough context to contribute. However, with Astro, the tool is so simple, well documented, and flexible that people can join an Astro project and be productive in 3-4 days.

### Performance Gains

Thinkmill ran their Astro site through [Unlighthouse](https://unlighthouse.dev/), which runs every page through [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?pli=1). Almost every page scored 100 for performance, best practices, SEO, and accessibility.
