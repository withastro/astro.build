# What is Astro?

**Astro makes web development easy. We make it possible to build fast websites with an easy-to-use platform that feels familiar to developers regardless of experience level.**

Astro launched in 2021 by introducing web **[partial hydration](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/partial-hydration/)** — a previously difficult-to-use web performance technology — to the world. Astro makes web development faster and easier, all while while supporting your favorite framework (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid.js, etc.)

Last year was a huge year for Astro: We took home the Jamstack Conf ["Ecosystem Innovation Award"](https://jamstackconf.com/jammies/) and become one of the fastest growing projects across all of GitHub in its first year. We amassed an amazing community of contributors and an even larger audience of 100,000+ developers using Astro every day at companies like Google, Netlify, Trivago, Rokt, The Guardian and more.

But we’re just getting started!
