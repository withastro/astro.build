<p>
  Astrobiz is a sleek and modern website design that uses the Tailwind CSS framework to create a
  clean and responsive layout. The site typically includes a hero section , two feature sections, a
  pricing table , and a contact us form.
</p>
<p>
  The hero section is the first thing visitors see when they land on the site. It often includes a
  large, attention-grabbing image or video along with a headline and a call-to-action button that
  encourages visitors to take action.
</p>
<p>
  The two feature sections highlight the key benefits of the business or product being offered. Each
  section typically includes an icon or image, a short description, and a call-to-action button that
  directs visitors to learn more or sign up.
</p>
<p>
  The pricing table displays the differen pricing tiers available for the product or service. Each
  tier is laid out in a clear and easy-to-read format, with features and benefits listed alongside
  the price.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, the contact us form allows visitors to get in touch with the business directly. This form
  typically includes fields for name, email address , and message, and may also include a phone
  number or other contact information.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, Astrobiz is a great choice for businesses looking for a modern, professional website
  that's easy to navigate and visually appealing.

<p>
  I quickly put this theme together with the help of chatgpt, free to use and the images are also
  generated with ai.
