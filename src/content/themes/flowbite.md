<h2>Flowbite Astro Admin Dashboard</h2>
<p>This project is a free and open-source UI admin dashboard template built with the components from <a
        href="https://flowbite.com">Flowbite</a> and based on the utility-first <a
        href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss">Tailwind CSS</a> framework featuring charts, tables,
    widgets, CRUD layouts, modals, drawers, and more.</p>
<p>This admin dashboard can quickly help you get started building an application for your project using the newest UI/UX
    development technologies in the open-source area including Tailwind CSS and Flowbite.</p>
<h3>Built with Flowbite</h3>
<p>The interactive components such as the navbars, modals, drawers, and tooltips are all based on the popular
    open-source component library called <a href="https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite">Flowbite</a> which enables
    us to use these elements by creating more complex set of pages and widgets inside a fully-fledged admin dashboard
    template.</p>
<h3>Tailwind CSS classes</h3>
<p>All of the pages, widgets, and components are solely based on the utility-first classes from <a
        href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> and it is compatible with the latest v3.x of the technology
    by automatically purging all of the classes based on the template paths.</p>
<h3>15 example pages</h3>
<p>Get started with 15 advanced examples pages including two different layouts of a dashboard's homepage full of charts
    widgets, tables, datepickers, and statistics and also with two CRUD layout pages for products, users, a settings
    page, authentication pages for login and register and even custom 404 and 500 error pages.</p>
<h3>Advanced UI components</h3>
<p>This admin dashboard contains many advanced components both from Flowbite but also from other third-party libraries
    such as ApexCharts which have been customly tailored with Tailwind CSS classes and designed based on the <a
        href="https://flowbite.com/figma/">Flowbite Design System</a>.</p>
<h3>Flowbite Documentation</h3>
<p>If you want to use this project we recommend to also study the <a
        href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">component library</a> that we used to build this
    dashboard because you can use even more components from that library to enhance the examples that we've coded here
    already.</p>
<h3>Development workflow</h3>
<p>This template was built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, <a
        href="https://flowbite.com/">Flowbite</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>.</p>
