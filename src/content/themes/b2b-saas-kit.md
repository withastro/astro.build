<p>
  The B2B SaaS Kit is an open-source starter toolkit for developers looking to quickly stand up a
  SaaS product where the customer can be a team of users (i.e., a business).
</p>
<p>
  The kit uses TypeScript, Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, and a number of third-party services that
  take care of essential, yet peripheral requirements, such as secrets management, user
  authentication, a database, product analytics, customer support, payments, and deployment
  infrastructure.
</p>
<p>The kit is designed with two primary goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Start with a fully-functional, relatively complex application. Then, modify it to become your
    own product.
  </li>
  <li>
    You should be able to build an app to validate your idea for the cost of a domain name - all the
    third-party services used by the kit offer meaningful free-forever starter plans.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Why "B2B"?</h2>
<p>
  "B2B" means "business-to-business". In the simplest terms, a B2B product is a product where
  post-signup, a user can create an organization, invite others, and do something as a team.
</p>
<p>
  B2B companies are fairly common - for example, over 40% of&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies"
    >Y Combinator-funded startups</a
  >&nbsp;self-identify as B2B - but B2B-specific starter kits appear to be quite rare, hence this
  effort.
