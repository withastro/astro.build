<p>
  All the interactiveness of the website is packed into three dropdowns that are located at the
  right of the top navigation bar. Every menu can be opened with a simple keyboard shortcut:
</p>
<p>- Table of contents: <strong>Shift + c</strong></p>
<p>- Search for an article: <strong>Shift + s</strong></p>
<p>- Theme toggle: <strong>Shift + t</strong></p>
<p>- Close menu: Escape (<strong>Esc</strong>)</p>
<p>
  The styles are simple, there are small improvements for some elements to keep everything
  consistent and responsive.
</p>
<h2>Table of contents</h2>
<p>Secondary headings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) are listed here, so each page is easy to navigate.</p>
<h2>Search</h2>
<p>
  I wrote a simple algorithm for the search, and the matching works well. You can write the blog
  title words in any order, leave letters out, have multiple spaces between words, and more.
</p>
<h2>Theme toggle</h2>
<p>
  There are three websites themes: Light, Dark and System (inherits the theme of your browser or
  operating system).
