<p>
  From the
  <a href="https://blog.pianopronto.com/steal-this-blog-part-1/">Steal This Blog!</a> series of
  articles, this blog theme is inspired by the Casper theme for Ghost CMS. It has some common blog
  features such as filtering by tags and dedicated author pages, as well as some other helpful
  features such as scheduled posts.
</p>
<p>
  Keep tuned as more features are added, such as search using&nbsp;<a
    href="https://github.com/oramasearch/orama"
    >orama</a
  >, meta images using <a href="https://github.com/vercel/satori">satori</a>, and possibly even a
  comment system.
