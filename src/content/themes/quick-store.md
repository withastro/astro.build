<p>Built with Astro.js</p>
<p>Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.</p>
<p>Styled with Tailwind CSS</p>
<p>
  Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other
  templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static
  CSS file.
</p>
<p>Relived with Alpine.js</p>
<p>
  Alpine is a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. Think of it like
  jQuery for the modern web. Plop in a script tag and get going.
</p>
<p>Keyboard accessible</p>
<p>
  Everything I build is keyboard accessible, and I meticulously write the markup to deliver the best
  screenreader experience I can provide.
</p>
<p>Production-ready</p>
<p>
  I tested the template in the latest versions of all browsers to handle lots of edge-cases you
  might encounter.
</p>
<p>Simple deploys</p>
<p>
  The template is production-ready and easily deployed anywhere that you can deploy a static
  wbsites, like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub pages, a bounch of options..
</p>
<h2>Plugins, integrations and stack.</h2>
<p>
  Supreme templates are thoughtfully crafted with the latest Astro, Tailwind and Alpine.js
  integrations and versions to keep it simple and easy to maintain.
