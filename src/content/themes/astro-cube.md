<p>
  A tiny, almost unopinionated starter for your next blog, documentation, personal/marketing
  website, and more.
</p>
<p>
  It comes with the <a
    href="https://cube.fyi/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >CUBE CSS</a
  > file structure, a methodology for building robust UIs in a declarative manner, and managing
  stylesheets efficiently no matter the size of the project.
</p>
<p>
  The project is mostly barebones, the goal isn't to provide an opionionated batteries-included
  template, just an easy starter kit and stylesheets to copy/paste from.
</p>
<p>
  Most styles are for demo purposes and to explain the underlying philosophy: "Be the browser's
  mentor, not its micromanager" (see <a
    href="https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/"
