[Bits&Letters](https://www.bitsandletters.com/?utm_source=astro&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=astro-agency-pgm) is a web design, development, and strategy company based in New York City. We've shaped design platforms at Adobe, Google, and Stripe—now we bring that experience to startups and growing teams building their next-generation web presence.

Our clients are typically companies from seed through Series B—as well as consultancies, agencies, and other SMBs—who've outgrown their [day-one websites](https://www.bitsandletters.com/ideas/why-your-first-site?utm_source=astro&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=astro-agency-pgm). Your original site got you this far, but now it can't keep pace with your growth. We rebuild it as a scalable system, digging into your specific challenges to build custom solutions tailored to how you actually work.

We sweat the details that matter for long-term success. Every site we build meets WCAG accessibility standards, follows security best practices, and performs well on slow connections. These aren't extras we bolt on at the end—they're built into our process from day one, so your site works well for everyone who visits it.
