Just threw the image in here for now. Probably want to change structure to like how the Press page is built so we don't have this banner/use the layout for the more minimal pages?

## ❤ Sponsorships and Official Partners

The easiest way to partner with Astro is to become a sponsor! Your financial contributions support the open-source project's ongoing maintenance and developent.

We recognize some levels of sponsorship with a logo and/or link on Astro sites such as our homepage, GitHub README, and docs website.

<Note color="red">
  💸 **To sponsor:** Visit [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/withastro) to see a full list of our contribution tiers.
</Note>

If you don't see your desired level of sponsorship listed, please contact us at `partner@astro.build`!

We are always happy to work directly with larger sponsors ($2000+ per month) to create a custom sponsorship package. There are also limited options for being an exclusive "official" partner for a particular category (e.g. Official CMS Partner).

## 📣 Co-Marketing

Co-marketing is partners helping each other by amplifying the others’ message, content, or resources to the benefit of both of communities. 

If you create or build something with or featuring us, we’re happy to share it! This could take the form of a social media post or boost, a blog post announcing our joint-feature, or placement in our newsletter.

For larger coordinated efforts, reach out to us to discuss a potential partnership with a financial arrangement.

<Note color="orange">
  ✍🏻 **To co-market:** Email partner@astro.build a brief summary of what you want us to amplify, where you want us to amplify it, and how it helps Astro users.
</Note>

## 🖥 Development

Astro stays lightweight, environmentally friendly, and blazingly fast by being a small set of core features with minimal dependencies. That's why Astro's integration ecosystem is so powerful! Astro integrations extend basic functionality on an opt-in basis. 

**Creating an Astro integration for your product or service is a great way to make it easy for people to use you in their Astro project, and grows the entire ecosystem!**

Don't have the time or people to build your own Astro integration for your company or product? You can partner with us to **directly fund development on an integration**. This allows Astro to prioritize the functionality you need, and create a plug-and-play way for Astro projects to use your service.

Is Astro missing a core feature that would allow you to use or migrate to it? As an open-source project, we welcome community contributors! Check out our [public roadmap](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap) and submit a proposal for missing features that you'd like to see added. If accepted, you are welcome to build it yourself with support and oversight of a core member.

**We also work with partners who are able to fund the development of these core features, so get in touch!**

<Note color="blue">
  ✍🏻 **To directly fund feature development:** Email partner@astro.build with a brief summary of who you are, and the feature or integration you need. 
</Note>

## 📑 Technical Case Studies

We’d love to interview companies that have used Astro for a complex use-case in production.

## 🎙 Podcasts and Livestreams

Let’s get together and talk about either Astro or a related topic! We can help coordinate booking different members of the core team as guests for your show.

## 📚 Third-party Guides

Developers rely heavily on high quality documentation and written resources when they build for the web. We believe you have a wealth of knowledge that both of our users can benefit from.

Recipes are step-by-step how-to guides to accomplish a specific task. They are hosted on your domain and linked to by us. Recipes allow you to get your content out quickly as it does not require a significant change to our docs site infrastructure. Here are some [examples of a Recipe](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/#community-resources).

<Note color="purple">
  ✍🏻 **To submit a community recipe:** Follow the instructions in the GitHub README.
