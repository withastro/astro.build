Just threw the image in here for now. Probably want to change structure to like how the Press page is built so we don't have this banner/use the layout for the more minimal pages?

## ❤ Sponsorships and Official Partners

The easiest way to partner with Astro is to become a sponsor! Your financial contributions support the open-source project's ongoing maintenance and developent.

We recognize some levels of sponsorship with a logo and/or link on Astro sites such as our homepage, GitHub README, and docs website.

<Note color="red">
  💸 **To sponsor:** Visit [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/withastro) to see a full list of our contribution tiers.
</Note>

If you don't see your desired level of sponsorship listed, please contact us at `partner@astro.build`!

We are always happy to work directly with larger sponsors ($2000+ per month) to create a custom sponsorship package. There are also limited options for being an exclusive "official" partner for a particular category (e.g. Official CMS Partner).

## ⭐️ Co-Marketing

Co-marketing is partners helping each other by amplifying the others’ message, content, or resources to the benefit of both of communities. 

If you create or build something with or featuring us, we’re happy to share it! This could take the form of a social media post or boost, a blog post announcing our joint-feature, or placement in our newsletter.

For larger coordinated efforts, reach out to us to discuss a potential partnership with a financial arrangement.

<Note color="orange">
  ✍🏻 **To co-market:** Email partner@astro.build a brief summary of what you want us to amplify, where you want us to amplify it, and how it helps Astro users.
</Note>

## ⭐️ Technology

Integrations are created to make it possible for two technologies to work well together. On the other hand, theme related projects at Astro are community submissions to our [theme marketplace](https://astro.build/themes/). The former makes it possible for both of our users to build the sites they need. The latter makes it easy for Astro users to customize the sites they build as they see fit.

Currently, Astro is able to collaborate on integrations as long as we are acting as an advisor or sounding board and you have already committed to the work. We are currently prioritizing integrations with CMS companies given our focus on content-rich websites. As for themes, Astro [welcomes theme submissions](https://astro.build/themes/submit/) from anyone that is passionate about supporting the community.

<Note color="blue">
  ✍🏻 **To contribute:** Email partner@astro.build with a brief summary of who you are, what integration you’re building, who you’re building for, and when you intend to release it. 
</Note>

## ⭐️ Technical Case Studies

We’d love to interview companies that have used Astro for a complex use-case in production.

<Note color="purple">
  ✍🏻 **To book an interview:** Email partner@astro.build with a description of your project.
</Note>

## ⭐️ Podcasts and Livestreams

Let’s get together and talk about either Astro or a related topic! We can help coordinate booking different members of the core team as guests for your show.

Note that most of our core team is located in the US and only available for opportunities to record in either the Eastern, Central, Pacific, or Atlantic time zones.

<Note color="purple">
  ✍🏻 **To book:** Email partner@astro.build with your show and available recording times.
</Note>

<Note color="orange">
  💸 **No paid content placement at this time!**
We’d still love to help you create great content that your audience will love.
</Note>

## ⭐️ Videos and Shorts

While we can’t provide video editing resources, we can offer our time to record on a joint project.

Note that most of our core team is located in the US and are only available for opportunities to record in either the Eastern, Central, Pacific, or Atlantic time zones.

<Note color="purple">
  ✍🏻 **To record:** Email partner@astro.build with your idea, timeline, and resources. All ideas should incorporate Astro in some way. Example: Tutorial series for Astro + X.

## ⭐️ Third-party Guides

Developers rely heavily on high quality documentation and written resources when they build for the web. We believe you have a wealth of knowledge that both of our users can benefit from.

Recipes are step-by-step how-to guides to accomplish a specific task. They are hosted on your domain and linked to by us. Recipes allow you to get your content out quickly as it does not require a significant change to our docs site infrastructure. Here are some [examples of a Recipe](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/#community-resources).

<Note color="purple">
  ✍🏻 **To submit a community recipe:** Follow the instructions in the GitHub README.
