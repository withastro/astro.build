## Sponsors and official partners

The easiest way to partner with Astro is to become a sponsor! Your financial contributions support the open-source project's ongoing maintenance and developent.

We recognize some levels of sponsorship with a logo and/or link on Astro sites such as our homepage, GitHub README, and docs website.

<Note>
	**To sponsor:** visit [Open
	Collective](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild) or [GitHub
	Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/withastro) and choose from a list of
	contribution tiers. Thank you for supporting Astro!
</Note>

If you don't see your desired level of sponsorship listed, please contact us at [partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build)!

We are always happy to work directly with larger sponsors ($2000+ per month) to create a custom sponsorship package. There are also limited options for being an exclusive "official" partner for a particular category ($10,000+ per month). Current official sponsors include:

- [Official Deployment Partner: Netlify](/blog/netlify-official-deployment-partner/)
- [Official App Monitoring Partner: Sentry](/blog/sentry-official-monitoring-partner/)
- [Official Online Editor Partner: Google Project IDX](/blog/idx-official-online-editor-partner/)

<Note>
	**To co-market:** email [partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) a
	brief summary of what you want us to amplify, where you want us to amplify it,
	and how it helps Astro users.
</Note>

### Development

Astro stays lightweight, environmentally friendly, and blazingly fast thanks to a focused set of core features with minimal dependencies. That's why Astro's integration ecosystem is so powerful! Astro integrations extend basic functionality on an opt-in basis.

**[Creating an Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference/) for your product or service is a great way to make it easy for people to use you in their Astro project, and grows the entire ecosystem!**

Don't have the time or expertise to build an Astro integration for your company or product? You can partner with us to **directly fund development of an integration**. This allows Astro to prioritize the functionality you need, and create a plug-and-play way for Astro projects to use your service.

Is Astro missing a core feature that would allow you to use or migrate to it? As an open-source project, we welcome community contributors! Check out our [public roadmap](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap) and submit a proposal for missing features that you'd like to see added. If accepted, you are welcome to build it yourself with support and oversight of a core maintainer.

**We also work with partners who are able to fund the development of these core features, so get in touch!**

<Note>
	**To directly fund feature development:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with a brief summary of who
	you are, and the feature or integration you need.
</Note>

### Technical case studies

We’d love to interview companies that have used Astro for a unique or complex use-case in production. [Case studies](/case-studies/) inspire confidence in using Astro and showcase your organization as an Astro adopter.

<Note>
	**To book an interview:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with a description of your
	project.
</Note>

### Podcasts and live streams

Let’s get together to talk about Astro or a related topic! We can help coordinate booking different members of the core team as guests for your show.

<Note>
	**To book:** email [partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with the
	name of your show or channel and available recording times.
</Note>

### Video content

Have an idea for compelling Astro content? Reach out and let us know how we can be involved!

<Note>
	**To record:** email [partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with
	your idea, timeline, and resources.
</Note>

### Third-party guides

Astro is proud of its commitment to documentation, and developers love our docs! Developers rely heavily on high quality documentation and written resources when they build for the web. When they don't get it, they move on and choose something else.

Astro accepts third-party guides for installing, configuring, and integrating services with Astro (e.g. content management systems, deploy hosts, storage solutions etc.) on a case-by-case basis. If accepted, our docs team will work with you to ensure a high quality, polished product up to the standard of our own documentation. These guides let Astro users know that your product or service can be used with Astro, and shows them exactly how to get started!

Please be advised that these documents can require extensive writing, testing, and editing to produce content that meets our documentation standards. Therefore, we may not always have the available resources to review and accept submissions. To help us include yours, you can **directly fund our docs team** to work with you on guides about using your product or service with Astro.

<Note>
	**To propose a guide or fund additional docs work:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with your service, timeline,
	and resources.
