### Development

Astro stays lightweight, environmentally friendly, and blazingly fast thanks to a focused set of core features with minimal dependencies. That's why Astro's integration ecosystem is so powerful! Astro integrations extend basic functionality on an opt-in basis.

**[Creating an Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference/) for your product or service is a great way to make it easy for people to use you in their Astro project, and grows the entire ecosystem!**

Don't have the time or expertise to build an Astro integration for your company or product? You can partner with us to **directly fund development of an integration**. This allows Astro to prioritize the functionality you need, and create a plug-and-play way for Astro projects to use your service.

Is Astro missing a core feature that would allow you to use or migrate to it? As an open-source project, we welcome community contributors! Check out our [public roadmap](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap) and submit a proposal for missing features that you'd like to see added. If accepted, you are welcome to build it yourself with support and oversight of a core maintainer.

**We also work with partners who are able to fund the development of these core features, so get in touch!**

<Note>
	**To directly fund feature development:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with a brief summary of who
	you are, and the feature or integration you need.
</Note>

### Starlight

Starlight is an entirely community-maintained solution for lightweight, performant, accessible, eco-friendly documentation with a healthy ecosystem of plugins and themes. It just works, out of the box, and is perfect for a docs-as-code solution for projects of any size.

Supporting Starlight is maintenance and development is a great way to contribute to high-quality, low-footprint documentation that is perfect for developer docs. With additional integrations, Starlight can power your entire web presence, including marketing pages and a blog!

Use Starlight for your docs? Consider supporting its ongoing maintenance and development through an Open Collective sponsorship, or reach out to us for additional partnership opportunities.

<Note>
	**To find out about Starlight partnership opportunities:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with a brief summary of you and/or your project, and how you'd like to collaborate with Starlight.

### Agency partners

The [Astro Agency Partner program](/agencies/) features a hand-picked group of agencies from around the world, who have demonstrated a track record in building high-quality Astro sites.

If you are an agency building with Astro, we want your quality work to be discoverable by potential clients, and also to give you a direct line to the core team of Astro maintainers.

<Note>

[Learn more](/agencies/join/) about the Astro Agency Partner program or [apply to join](/agencies/application/).

</Note>

### Theme sponsors

The [Astro Theme Catalogue](/themes/) is often the first stop for visitors looking to get up and running with a pre-made Astro site quickly. Our catalogue is the largest collection of Astro themes and templates, containing over 500 free and paid options.

If you are building paid themes for Astro, you can donate to Astro's Open Collective as a Theme Sponsor, and designate one or more of your themes to be listed on our main themes page, before visitors enter the full site of listings.

<Note>

[See current featured themes](/themes/) and [learn how your theme can be featured](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild/contribute/theme-sponsor-86430).

</Note>

### Technical case studies

We’d love to interview companies that have used Astro for a unique or complex use-case in production. [Case studies](/case-studies/) inspire confidence in using Astro and showcase your organization as an Astro adopter.

<Note>
	**To book an interview:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with a description of your
	project.
</Note>

### Video content, podcasts, and live streams

Have an idea for compelling Astro content? Let’s get together to talk about Astro or a related topic! We can help coordinate booking different members of the core team as guests for your show.

<Note>
	**To book:** email [partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with the
	name of your show or channel and available recording times.
</Note>

### Third-party guides

Astro is proud of its commitment to documentation, and developers love our docs! Developers rely heavily on high quality documentation and written resources when they build for the web. When they don't get it, they move on and choose something else.

Astro accepts third-party guides for installing, configuring, and integrating services with Astro (e.g. content management systems, deploy hosts, storage solutions etc.) on a case-by-case basis. If accepted, our docs team will work with you to ensure a high quality, polished product up to the standard of our own documentation. These guides let Astro users know that your product or service can be used with Astro, and shows them exactly how to get started!

Please be advised that these documents can require extensive writing, testing, and editing to produce content that meets our documentation standards. Therefore, we may not always have the available resources to review and accept submissions. To help us include yours, you can **directly fund our docs team** to work with you on guides about using your product or service with Astro.

<Note>
	**To propose a guide or fund additional docs work:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with your service, timeline,
	and resources.
</Note>

### Community Events

Astro is nothing without the community behind it! We would love to better support events, meetup groups, and conferences and the people who organize and represent Astro at them.

We also occassionally plan official in-person events ourselves such as [Astro Together](/blog/astro-together-montreal/) and launch events like the [Astro Solstice Festival](/blog/solstice-festival/).

Sponsorship can help send Astro community maintainers to speak at conferences, fund a booth or swag items for attendees, or make an entire event possible!

<Note>
	**To help with creating, organizing, or sponsoring an event:** email
	[partner@astro.build](mailto:partner@astro.build) with a proposal, or to see which events we are currently trying to attend.
</Note>

### Newsletter Advertising

Astro's newsletter "The Astro Post" reaches thousands of people each month with a round up of the latest news, releases, and community showcase items. This is a completely community-funded THING keeps people informed and provides the latest tips and tools to help people get the most out of Astro.

Astro's newsletter is delivered directly to subscriber inboxes, and is permanently available in a web archive. Each month, we suggest articles, videos, and developer tools related to working with Astro. There are opportunities to feature your content, include an advertisment, or sponsor the month's newsletter so that our audience stays educated and informed.

<Note>

### Sponsored Swag

Astro's official swag shop [AstroMart](https://shop.astro.build/) is a community initiative to provide our community with opportunities to show off their Astro pride! All shop maintenance, from product design to order fulfullment, is supported by open source funds, and all profits are reinvested in the project.

We regularly offer special product lines for seasonal events or other promotions. Your sponsorship can help support the design of new products and maintenance of the store itself.
