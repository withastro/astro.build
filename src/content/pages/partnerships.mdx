**Welcome! Thank you for your interest in collaborating with the Astro team!**

We want to make web development easy. However, the web is a huge domain and there are so many things developers can build. If you’re here, that means there’s a good chance you’re passionate about the same thing we are and also recognize that we can change the web for the better together. We are committed to growing the Astro ecosystem to help more developers benefit, not only from Astro but, from any other tool they need to build the web - including yours!

## ⭐️ Sponsorships and Official Partners

Astro is an open-source project that accepts financial sponsorship via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild). 100% of funds raised go to help support and sustain our volunteer-driven open source community. Funds are explicitly not available to The Astro Technology Company, the company formed to help support the project. [Learn more about how we handle sponsorship funds.](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/FUNDING.md)

Sponsorship is a good option if you want to get your logo on our homepage, GitHub READMEs, or docs website. This is also a good option if you want to explore being named the “official” partner for a certain category. We are always happy to work directly with larger sponsors ($2000+ per month) to create a custom sponsorship package. See Open Collective for more details.

## ⭐️ Technology

Integrations are created to make it possible for two technologies to work well together. On the other hand, theme related projects at Astro are community submissions to our [theme marketplace](https://astro.build/themes/). The former makes it possible for both of our users to build the sites they need. The latter makes it easy for Astro users to customize the sites they build as they see fit.

Currently, Astro is able to collaborate on integrations as long as we are acting as an advisor or sounding board and you have already committed to the work. We are currently prioritizing integrations with CMS companies given our focus on content-rich websites. As for themes, Astro [welcomes theme submissions](https://astro.build/themes/submit/) from anyone that is passionate about supporting the community.

<Note color="blue">
  ✍🏻 **To contribute:** Email partner@astro.build with a brief summary of who you are, what integration you’re building, who you’re building for, and when you intend to release it. 
</Note>

## ⭐️ Co-Marketing

Co-marketing involves partners helping each other by amplifying the others’ message, content, or resources as long as it benefits both of our users. 

If you create or build something with or featuring us, we’re happy to help amplify. Some examples are a retweet, a blog post announcing our joint-feature, etc.

<Note color="orange">
  ✍🏻 **To co-market:** Email partner@astro.build a brief summary of what you want us to amplify, where you want us to amplify it, and how it helps Astro users.
</Note>

## ⭐️ Technical Case Studies

We’d love to interview companies that have used Astro for a complex use-case in production.

## ⭐️ Podcasts and Livestreams

Let’s get together and talk about either Astro or a related topic! We can help coordinate booking different members of the core team as guests for your show.

Note that most of our core team is located in the US and only available for opportunities to record in either the Eastern, Central, Pacific, or Atlantic time zones.

## ⭐️ Community Recipes

Developers rely heavily on high quality documentation and written resources when they build for the web. We believe you have a wealth of knowledge that both of our users can benefit from.

Recipes are step-by-step how-to guides to accomplish a specific task. They are hosted on your domain and linked to by us. Recipes allow you to get your content out quickly as it does not require a significant change to our docs site infrastructure. Here are some [examples of a Recipe](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/#community-resources).

<Note color="purple">
  ✍🏻 **To submit a community recipe:** Follow the instructions in the GitHub README.
