## üñ• Development

Astro stays lightweight, environmentally friendly, and blazingly fast by being a small set of core features with minimal dependencies. That's why Astro's integration ecosystem is so powerful! Astro integrations extend basic functionality on an opt-in basis. 

**Creating an Astro integration for your product or service is a great way to make it easy for people to use you in their Astro project, and grows the entire ecosystem!**

Don't have the time or people to build your own Astro integration for your company or product? You can partner with us to **directly fund development of an integration**. This allows Astro to prioritize the functionality you need, and create a plug-and-play way for Astro projects to use your service.

Is Astro missing a core feature that would allow you to use or migrate to it? As an open-source project, we welcome community contributors! Check out our [public roadmap](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap) and submit a proposal for missing features that you'd like to see added. If accepted, you are welcome to build it yourself with support and oversight of a core member.

**We also work with partners who are able to fund the development of these core features, so get in touch!**

<Note color="purple">
  ‚úçüèª **To directly fund feature development:** Email `partner@astro.build` with a brief summary of who you are, and the feature or integration you need. 
</Note>

## üìö Third-party Guides

Astro is proud of its commitment to documentation, and developers love our docs! Developers rely heavily on high quality documentation and written resources when they build for the web. When they don't get it, they move on and choose something else.

Astro accepts third-party guides for installing, configuring, and integrating services with Astro (e.g. content management systems, deploy hosts, storage solutions etc.) on a case-by-case basis. If accepted, our docs team will work with you to ensure a high quality, polished product up to the standard of our own documentation. These guides let Astro users know that your product or service can be used with Astro, and shows them exactly how to get started!

Please be advised that these documents can require extensive writing, testing, and editing to produce content that meets our documentation standards. Therefore, we may not always have the available resources to review and accept submissions. To help us include yours, you can **directly fund our docs team** to work with you on guides about using your product or service with Astro.

<Note color="purple">
  ‚úçüèª **To propose a guide or fund additional docs work:** Email `partner@astro.build` with your service, timeline, and resources.
