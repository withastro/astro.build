## Partner benefits

### Qualified leads

**Connect with leads discovering your agency through our exclusive partner directory.**

Your agency will have a listing on [the directory page](/agencies/), as well as a fully-branded profile page with custom copy, graphics, and a link to your website. This directory is linked from the navigation of every page on the Astro site, which currently receives over three million page views from 250k unique users every month. Agency partners are also the first choice for direct referrals from the Astro team.

### Demonstrate credibility

**Demonstrate your Astro credentials on your own marketing with official branding.**

Agency partners are provided assets to display your partner status on your own site and marketing materials. These can be added to both print and digital material to let your clients know that your agency is officially endorsed as an Astro expert.

### Co-marketing

**Collaborate with Astro’s content team on joint marketing activities.**

Take advantage of Astro’s existing marketing and audience to have case studies featured on [the Astro blog](/blog/), your own announcements amplified on social media, or featured placement in the Astro newsletter. Access co-branded whitepapers to share with potential clients to help convince and convert customers.

### A direct line to the core team

**Be first in line with direct communication.**

Partners have access to a private Discord channel where you can ask questions, give feedback, and chat with the Astro core team. Partner-only updates will give you first look at new features, and a chance to comment on proposals that are in development.

### Support the open source project

**The Astro open source project is primarily funded by our partners and sponsors.**

We’re in this together! The Astro Agency Partner program will not only highlight agencies like yours, but also help support the Astro open source project, funding future maintenance and development of new features.
