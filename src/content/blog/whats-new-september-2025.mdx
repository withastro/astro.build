## Community

### Astro Team News

We're excited to announce our newest Astro maintainer, [Louis Escher](https://github.com/louisescher)! Please join us in welcoming yet another amazing contributor to the ranks!

### Updates from... the past!

We heard you liked webrings, so we've created two pixel-perfect badges you can add to your site to show your love for Astro and Houston!

<div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-0">
<img src="/assets/blog/whats-new/built-with-astro.webp" alt="Built with Astro and a pixelated Astro logo." />
<img src="/assets/blog/whats-new/friends-of-houston.webp" alt="Friends of Houston on a purple badge with a small smiling Houston." />
</div>

(And you want shiny? We got shiny.)
<img src="/assets/blog/whats-new/friends-of-houston.gif" alt="Friends of Houston on a purple badge with a small smiling Houston with an animated sparkle." />


### Upcoming Events

Heading to [ViteConf](https://viteconf.amsterdam) in October? You'll be able to meet speakers <Mention name="matt" />, <Mention name="sarah" />, and several other core members of the Astro team who will be attending!

We'll also be sticking around a little longer in Amsterdam and would love to meet you! More details to come, but you can save the date. Drinks are on Netlify!

<BlogContentImage 
  src={astroHappyHour} 
  alt="An invitation to save the date for Astro Happy Hour in Amsterdam, 11 October, with a large Houston floating in an Amsterdam city canal. Sponsored by Netlify."
/>

And get ready for <Mention name="reuben"/> speaking at React Advanced London in November, who will help you [Navigate Islands of Interactivity](https://reactadvanced.com/#person-reuben-tier).

### Hot topics

Hot on the heels of the announcement of our [partnership with Mux](https://astro.build/blog/mux-official-video-partner/), this month saw two new Mux Astro integrations, a new Astro docs [guide for using Mux in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/media/mux/), and community videos about how to get started from some of our favourite Astro content creators!

  ]}
/> 

Did you know that [CodeTV already runs on Astro + Mux](https://astro.build/case-studies/codetv/)? (Sorry not sorry that Jason might now want to update to the official native components. üòÇ)

### Did you know?

We recently added an improvement to our pull request (PR) workflow that helps contributors help *you* understand the changes they have made to the Astro codebase. 

Our new workflow automatically checks any changesets and validates them against our [changeset writing and style guidelines](https://contribute.docs.astro.build/docs-for-code-changes/changesets/). It helps us ensure that changes are described helpfully and consistently, with a focus on the user-facing changes so that readers will always know what an implementation detail means when it comes to the code in your own project. And, this workflow will also catch things like improper Markdown heading levels that will break formatting when your changeset is added to the full `CHANGELOG.md`.

We're proud of Astro's commitment to documenting our code changes, from patch releases to major upgrade guides. Thank you <Mention name="matt" /> for contributing this feature!
