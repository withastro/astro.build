**Astro 5.1 is now available! Delivered just in time for the holidays, the first minor release of the Astro 5 era includes a new experimental sessions feature, improved caching for images, and extra tools for working with Astro Actions.**

The gifts it comes bearing include:

- [**Experimental: Sessions**](#experimental-sessions)
- [**Remote image caching**](#remote-image-caching)
- [**`getActionPath` helper**](#getactionpath-helper)


To upgrade an existing project, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. Alternatively, upgrade manually by running the upgrade command for your package manager:

```sh
# Recommended:
npx @astrojs/upgrade

# Manual:
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro --latest
yarn upgrade astro --latest
```


## Experimental: Sessions

If youâ€™ve built apps with frameworks like Rails or Laravel, youâ€™re probably familiar with sessions: a simple way to keep track of per-user data like login status, flash messages, or shopping carts as users navigate your site. Sessions let you securely store temporary data tied to a specific user â€“ with no client-side storage required. Currently, you might store data in a cookie or local storage, but that can be insecure or cumbersome â€“ or has limits on how much data you can store. 

Sessions work by storing data on the server, and only sending a session ID as a cookie to the client. You can then `get` and `set` the session data in your Astro pages and components, API endpoints, Astro Actions, and middleware. The API and data are the same for each of them. 

In Astro components and pages, you can access the session object as `Astro.session`:

```astro {4}
---
// src/components/CartButton.astro
export const prerender = false;
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
---

<a href="/cart">ðŸ›’ {cart?.length ?? 0} items</a>
```
The same session data is available in your Astro Actions:

```ts {9,11}
// src/actions/addToCart.ts
import { defineAction } from "astro:actions";
import { z } from "astro:schema";

export const server = {
  addToCart: defineAction({
    input: z.object({ productId: z.string() }),
    handler: async (input, context) => {
      const cart = await context.session.get("cart");
      cart.push(input.productId);
      await context.session.set("cart", cart);
      return cart;
    },
  }),
};
```

Sessions work on pages that are rendered on-demand, or they pair perfectly with [server islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#server-islands), letting you sprinkle islands of personalized content in an otherwise static site.

```astro
---
import CartButton from '../components/CartButton.astro';
---
<CartButton server:defer />
```

### Drivers

Astro sessions are powered by [unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/) drivers, which are modules that Astro uses to store the session data. Unstorage supports dozens of providers, giving you a world of choice for storing user data.

When sessions become a stable feature, Astro's official adapters will automatically configure a default driver. But during this experimental phase, you must configure a `driver` for your chosen adapter yourself. You can also use a cross-platform driver such as [Upstash](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/upstash) or [Redis](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/redis).

### Usage

To try experimental sessions, add the `experimental.sessions` flag to your `astro.config.mjs`:

This example shows how to enable the filesystem driver, which works with the Node.js adapter:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-8}
  {
    adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),
    experimental: {
      session: {
        // Required: the name of the Unstorage driver
        driver: "fs",
      },
    },
  }
```

For more information see [the sessions docs for this experimental flag ](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/sessions/). We'd also appreciate your feedback on the feature. For even more details, and to leave feedback and participate in the development of the feature, see [the Sessions RFC](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/pull/1055).

## Remote image caching

You already know and love the built-in `<Image />` component to [display optimized images](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#display-optimized-images-with-the-image--component) with automatic resizing and optimization. While this component currently transforms both local and remote images, image caching between builds was limited to local images. 

Now, Astro will cache remote images as well, reducing the need to re-download and re-transform images on every build. It uses [conditional requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests#conditional_headers) with [`If-Modified-Since`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since) or [`If-None-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) headers to determine whether the image is still fresh, and will use the cached version unless the source image has changed. 

This is now enabled for all sites and will work with any host that supports conditional requests. See the new [asset caching docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#asset-caching) for details.

Special thanks to [@oliverlynch](https://github.com/oliverlynch), who contributed this feature!

## `getActionPath` helper

Using Astro Actions is as simple as calling `actions.like()` or `actions.addToCart()`. But sometimes you need to know the URL of an action so you can make a `fetch()` request with custom headers, or use an API such as `navigator.sendBeacon()`.

Astro 5.1 introduces a new helper function, `getActionPath()` to give you more flexibility when calling your action.

Need to authorize those likes? Call your `like` action passing the `Authorization` header and the [`keepalive`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/keepalive) option:

```astro title="src/components/my-component.astro" {8,11}
<script>
import { actions, getActionPath } from 'astro:actions'

await fetch(getActionPath(actions.like), {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ id: 'YOUR_ID' }),
  keepalive: true
})
</script>
```

For more information, see [the new `getActionPath()` documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-actions/#getactionpath).
