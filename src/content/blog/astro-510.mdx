**Astro 5.1 is now available! Delivered just in time for the holidays, the first minor release of the Astro 5 era includes a new experimental sessions feature, improved caching for images, and extra tools for building Astro Actions.**

The gifts it bears include:

- [**Remote image caching**](#remote-image-caching)
- [**Experimental: Sessions**](#experimental-sessions)
- [**`getActionPath` helper**](#getactionpath-helper)


To upgrade an existing project, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. Alternatively, upgrade manually by running the upgrade command for your package manager:

```sh
# Recommended:
npx @astrojs/upgrade

# Manual:
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro --latest
yarn upgrade astro --latest
```

## Remote image caching

Astro sites can use the built-in `<Image />` component to [display optimized images](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#display-optimized-images-with-the-image--component) with automatic resizing and optimization. This works with both local and remote images. 

Astro already caches transformed local images between builds, but previously did not cache remote images. Now, Astro will cache remote images as well, reducing the need to re-download and re-transform images on every build. It uses conditional requests with `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match` headers to determine whether the image is still fresh, and will use the cached version unless the source image has changed. 

This is now enabled for all sites, and will work with any host that supports conditional requests. See the new [asset caching docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#asset-caching) for details.

## Experimental: Sessions

If youâ€™ve built apps with frameworks like Rails or Laravel, youâ€™re probably familiar with sessions: a simple way to keep track of per-user data like login status, flash messages, or shopping carts as users navigate your site. Sessions let you securely store temporary data tied to a specific user â€“ with no client-side storage required. Currently you might store data in a cookie or local storage, but that can be insecure or cumbersome â€“ or has limits on how much data you can store. 

Sessions work by storing data on the server, and only sending a session ID as a cookie to the client. You can then get and set the session data in your Astro pages, API endpoints, Astro Actions, and middleware. The API and data is the same for each of them. In Astro components and pages, you can access the session object as `Astro.session`:

```astro 
---
// src/components/CartButton.astro
export const prerender = false;
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
---

<a href="/cart">ðŸ›’ {cart?.length ?? 0} items</a>
```
The same session data is available in your Astro Actions:

```ts {9,11}
// src/actions/addToCart.ts
import { defineAction } from "astro:actions";
import { z } from "astro:schema";

export const server = {
  addToCart: defineAction({
    input: z.object({ productId: z.string() }),
    handler: async (input, context) => {
      const cart = await context.session.get("cart");
      cart.push(input.productId);
      await context.session.set("cart", cart);
      return cart;
    },
  }),
};
```

Sessions work on pages that are rendered on-demand, or they pair perfectly with [server islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#server-islands), letting you sprinkle islands of personalized content in an otherwise static site.

```astro
---
import CartButton from '../components/CartButton.astro';
---
<CartButton server:defer />
```

### Drivers

Astro sessions are powered by [Unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/) drivers, which are modules that Astro uses to store the session data. Unstorage supports dozens of providers, giving you a world of choice for storing the user data. When sessions are a stable feature, adapters will automatically configure a default driver, but during the experimental phase you must choose and configure one yourself. When using the Node.js adapter, the best choice is usually the [filesystem driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/fs), but this cannot be used in serverless environments as they have no shared filesystem. For these, the best default is usually the storage feature provided by the platform, such as the [Netlify Blobs driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/netlify), the [Cloudflare KV driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/cloudflare) or the [Deno KV driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/deno). You can also use a cross-platform driver such as [Upstash](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/upstash) or [Redis](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/redis).

### Usage

To try experimental sessions, add a `sessions` key to your `astro.config.mjs`:

This example shows how to enable the filesystem driver, which works with the Node.js adapter:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-8}
	{
    adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),
		experimental: {
      session: {
        // Required: the name of the Unstorage driver
        driver: "fs",
      },
    },
	}
```

For more information see [the docs for the experimental flag](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/sessions/). We'd also appreciate your feedback on the feature. For more details, see [the Sessions RFC](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/pull/1055) and leave your comments.

## `getActionPath` helper

In most cases, using Astro Actions is as simple as calling `actions.like()` or `actions.addToCart()`. But sometimes you need to know the URL of an action, for example when you want to make a request with custom headers, or use an API such as `navigator.sendBeacon()`. Astro 5.1 introduces a new helper function, `getActionPath`, which returns the URL of an action. 

```ts
import { actions, getActionPath } from 'astro:actions'

const path = getActionPath(actions.like) // '/_actions/like'
```

For more information, see [the new `getActionPath` documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-actions/#getactionpath).

## Bug fixes
We've had loads of great feedback since [the Astro 5 release](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5), and we've been working hard to fix the issues you've reported. See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for all of the fixes since Astro 5.0.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, and to everyone who's been using Astro and sharing their feedback. We're excited to see what you build with Astro 5.1!
