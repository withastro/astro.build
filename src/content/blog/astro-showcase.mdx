Today, we are proud to launch [The Astro Showcase](https://astro.build/showcase): a place to explore beautiful community websites built with Astro. Use the showcase for inspiration, or just to check out what’s possible in Astro. We are proud to be powering the teams behind these awesome sites, including [Google Firebase](https://firebase.blog/), [Trivago](https://tech.trivago.com/), [The Guardian](https://developers.theguardian.com/), [Daily Dev Tips](https://daily-dev-tips.com/) and more.
