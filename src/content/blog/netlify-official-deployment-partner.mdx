We are thrilled to announce [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_campaign=Astro-2024&utm_source=astro-referral) 
as Astro's new **Official Deployment Partner**.

This new partnership will guarantee more collaboration, more features, and an even better experience for Astro developers on Netlify.

Netlify will be sponsoring $12,500 each month towards the ongoing open source maintenance and development of Astro. 
The new sponsorship funding will be invested directly back into our open source community and long-term maintenance, benefiting everyone.

Here’s what Mathias Biilmann of Netlify had to say about the news:

	<Fragment slot="quote" >
		Astro is no doubt one of my favorite open-source projects and brings a renewed sense of simplicity to front-end development. I've always been a fan of the island architecture and Astro has managed to build a best-in-class framework around that. At Netlify we're excited to partner with the Astro team to help developers create and unlock the power of the web.

## Betting on Server Islands

Netlify is actively supporting our work to bring Server Islands to Astro later this year. Server Islands 
let you define sections of personalized, dynamic content on otherwise static pages of HTML. The result? 
A website that loads instantly with static “page shells” served from your global CDN and dynamic islands loaded separately.

Server Islands don’t require any special or proprietary infrastructure and will work wherever Astro runs today. 
We are excited to keep collaborating with Netlify on this feature. We are joining forces to make sure 
that Netlify users have a great experience with Server Islands as we move towards a public, non-experimental 
launch of Server Islands later this year. 

Check back later this week for some exciting updates.

## Astro ❤️ Netlify

Astro is honored and excited to have [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_campaign=Astro-2024&utm_source=astro-referral) as our new official deployment partner. We are grateful for the support of Mathias Biilmann and the entire Netlify team for their help and evangelism of open-source software. It's because of support from companies like Netlify that we are able to receive ongoing maintenance and keep developing Astro in an open, financially sustainable way.

You can learn more about how we use these funds by reading our [FUNDING.md](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/FUNDING.md) document on GitHub.

Thanks, Netlify!
