import Mention from "/src/components/Mention.astro"

The Astro project has a new Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for 2025! I am excited to announce <Mention name="ema" /> <Mention name="florian" /> and <Mention name="matt" /> are now part of the Astro TSC, joining <Mention name="matthew" /> who will remain on the TSC.

In addition, I am also proud to recognize <Mention name="matt" /> as the official Astro framework team lead going forward, joining <Mention name="sarah" /> who will continue as the project's official docs team lead.

This announcement is part of our ongoing commitment to open governance and bringing you the best framework for building content-driven websites. If you're curious to learn more, you can read our entire set of public [governance docs on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#get-involved), see our [full list of maintainers](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/MEMBERS.md), and chat with us [on Discord](https://astro.build/chat).

## What is the Astro TSC?

We created the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) in 2022 [(PR #3490)](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/3490) to support Astroâ€™s rapid growth in the early days of the project. Astro usage was soaring â€” npm downloads were doubling monthly â€” and our core team of maintainers had expanded to include new members with new skill sets (docs, design, community-building) outside of just coding. Astro needed a smaller, focused group to make core technical decisions more effectively.

> *A TSC member guides the direction of the project and ensures a healthy future for the Astro codebase. TSC members are ultimately responsible for technical decision-making when it comes to any changes to the Astro codebase.*
> 
> *A TSC member has significant sway in software design decisions. For this reason, coding experience is critical for this role. TSC membership is one of the only roles that requires a significant contribution history of code to the Astro project on GitHub.*
>
> -- [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) Â· June 7, 2022

Earlier this year, we revisited the TSC structure for the first time since its creation. Our core team voted to simplify the membership process [(PR #53)](https://github.com/withastro/.github/pull/53) to make it easier to add/remove members to the TSC, cap the size of the TSC to 5 members maximum, and remove the eligibility of the project steward (Hi, that's me! ðŸ‘‹) to serve directly on the TSC. This new structure gives our most active core contributors the well-earned autonomy and responsibility to own the health of the codebase going forward (and frees me up to focus even more of my time on project stewardship, finding new partnerships, sponsors, etc.)

Each TSC member â€” Ema, Florian, Matt, and Matthew â€” has already made major contributions to the Astro codebase as a maintainer and played a significant role in growing the framework into what it is today. I am extremely grateful for their continued leadership of the project.

When you talk about governance in open source, it's easy to assume that all of this is about slow, boring bureaucracy. But in our case, it's had the exact oppositeÂ effect. Having clear roles and responsibilities has helped us move *faster* with focus â€” especially on a distributed, async team like Astro. Our TSC model was inspired by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with early guidance from [Nicholas Zakas](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/), who is a brilliant open source maintainer and project steward that we have been lucky to learn from.
