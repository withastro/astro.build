import Mention from "/src/components/Mention.astro"

The Astro project has a new Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for 2025! I am excited to announce <Mention name="ema" /> <Mention name="florian" /> and <Mention name="matt" /> are now part of the Astro TSC, joining Matthew Phillips who will remain on the TSC. 

In addition, I am also proud to recognize <Mention name="matt" /> as the official Astro framework team lead going forward, joining <Mention name="sarah" /> who will continue as the project's official docs team lead.

This announcement is part of our ongoing commitment to open governance and bringing you the best framework for building content-driven websites. If you're curious to learn more, you can read our entire set of public governance docs [on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#get-involved), see our [full list of maintainers](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/MEMBERS.md), and chat with us [on Discord](https://astro.build/chat).

## What is the Astro TSC?

We created the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) in 2022 [(PR #3490)](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/3490) to support Astro’s rapid growth in the early days of the project. Astro usage was soaring — npm downloads were doubling monthly — and our core team of maintainers had expanded to include new members with new skillsets (docs, design, community-building) outside of just coding. We needed a smaller, focused group to make core technical decisions more effectively.

The TSC was formed to be ultimately responsible for the long-term health and growth of the Astro codebase. To quote directly from the [official Astro governance](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md):

> *A TSC member guides the direction of the project and ensures a healthy future for the Astro codebase. TSC members are ultimately responsible for technical decision making when it comes to any changes to the Astro codebase.*
> 
> *A TSC member has significant sway in software design decisions. For this reason, coding experience is critical for this role. TSC membership is one of the only roles that requires a significant contribution history of code to the Astro project on GitHub.*
>
> *The TSC is limited to a maximum of **5** members at any one time. This size ensures adequate coverage of important areas of expertise balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.*
>
> *The Steward is not eligible for the TSC, but may participate in TSC discussions and has a role in guiding the conversation to consensus (see [<u>Voting: RFC Proposals</u>](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#voting-rfc-proposals)).*

Open source governance sometimes gets a bad reputation for being slow or bureaucratic. But in our case, it's been the opposite. Having clear roles and responsibilities has helped us move *faster* — especially on a distributed, async team like ours

Our TSC model was inspired by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with guidance from [Nicholas Zakas](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/), who is a brilliant open source maintainer and project steward that we have been lucky to learn from.

## Get Involved

Each TSC member — Ema, Matt, Florian, and Matthew — has already made major contributions to Astro and played a significant role in growing the framework into what it is today. We are lucky and grateful for their continued leadership of the project.
