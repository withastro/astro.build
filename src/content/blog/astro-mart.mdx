Welcome to the Astro Solstice Festival! The sun is high, the planets are aligning, and the siren song of celebration calls to us. All week, we’re going to be toasting the best of Astro, joining forces with Astro experts, and learning how to use new features.

But first… where must an intrepid adventurer go to prepare themselves for an interstellar jamboree? To [Astro Mart][shop] — bespoke outfitters to discerning astronauts everywhere!

## New look, new swag

We’ve given the Astro merch shop a lick of paint and rustled up brand new designs, including a unique set of products for the summer. Whether you want to rep the classic Astro logo, a smiling Houston, or the perfect sticker to add to your collection, you’ll find something for you at Astro Mart.

Even better, we are now able to ship internationally, boldly taking Astro swag where no Astro swag has gone before!
