I’m thrilled to announce the winners of Astro Contributor Awards for 2022!

**What are the Astro Contributor Awards?** Every few months during 2022, we distributed 100% of our **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild)** sponsorship funds for an entire month to standout members of our community. These awards are peer-nominated within our Discord, and go to recognize the people who go above and beyond to improve Astro in any meaningful way.

This time around, our monthly sponsorships totalled almost **$8500** which we are proud to distribute to the following recipients:

- **@happydev($1000)**
- **@hippo ($500)**
- **@Yan ‘Sidebar’ Thomas ($500)**
- **@kevinzunigacuellar ($500)**

Thanks to these awesome Astronauts, we have first-class documentation support in six languages! A wonderful range of amazing Astro Integrations, a fantastic support channel, there is so much more than I can list here! But most importantly for creating a friendly Discord community that everyone feels welcome in, Astro is a commons and it’s our users who help drive the project to new heights.  

If you have contributed to Astro in any way over the past year, thank you. Astro is what it is today because of this amazing community. You can **[join us on Discord](https://astro.build/chat)** to learn more about these awards and the standout work done by this latest batch of recipients.

Lastly, a huge thank you to our amazing sponsors — including **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**, **[Storyblok](https://storyblok.com/)**, **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**, and **[Google](http://google.com/)** — for supporting open source software and helping to make programs like this posssible.
