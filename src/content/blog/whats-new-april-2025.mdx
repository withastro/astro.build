## Community

Astro wouldn’t be what it is without its community. From Discord support, to documentation improvements, to translations, to code contributions, Astro welcomes it all.

### Astro Team News

We have a new Technical Steering Committee (TSC)!

Welcome core maintainers <Mention name="ema" /> <Mention name="florian" /> and <Mention name="matt" /> to the Astro TSC, joining current member <Mention name="matthew" />, to guide Astro's technical direction and ensure a healthy codebase for many years to come!

[Read more about the 2025 TSC](/blog/astro-tsc-2025/)

Additionally, Matt has stepped into the role of framework team lead alongside <Mention name="sarah" />, our current docs team lead!


### Open source feel-good Story

Last month's "What's New?" included a blog post by Angelika Cathor on [the implications of Astro's HTML streaming](https://angelika.me/2025/03/16/implications-of-astro-html-streaming/) and detailed their current workaround in use.

In response, Astro core team member <Mention name="luiz" /> not only identified an issue in a 3rd-party service and [contributed a bug fix](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15995), but also created [an Astro integration to allow you to disable Astro's streaming](https://inox-tools.fryuni.dev/cut-short) featured below in *this* month's Tips and Tools section.


## Content

- 🙅 Check out Aaron Morey's [anti-social Astro microblog](https://aaronmorey.com/micros/) that only *looks* like a social network feed: the comment, like, and repost buttons are a lie! (And, you'll never have to read the comments.)
