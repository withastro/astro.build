We are excited to be partnering with Cloudinary to launch the [Astro x Cloudinary SDK](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/?utm_source=astro.build&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=devx_astro_cloudinary&utm_content=homepage_pill). 

With the SDK, you can easily optimize and transform your images and videos. This includes the ability to dynamically crop or resize, 
remove the background, use generative AI, and more. The SDK also offers a widget for easy uploading as well as a video player for ✨ delightful ✨ embeds.

Here’s what Colby Fayock of Cloudinary had to say about us working together:

		I'm a big believer in what Astro's bringing to the ecosystem and I'm excited to be a part of it with our launch of the Astro Cloudinary SDK. The story hasn't been told yet for how you can incorporate image and video workflows at scale, but now we're able to help developers of any website or app build amazing visual experiences for the web.

## Improving Asset Management

The Astro x Cloudinary SDK further improves the developer experience for working with [Astro Collections](https://astro.cloudinary.dev/?utm_source=astro.build&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=devx_astro_cloudinary&utm_content=homepage_pill).

From the Astro team, here's what Matthew Phillips had to say about this collaboration:

		Cloudinary as a launch partner with Astro is a perfect fit. Cloudinary gives you asset management and transformation capabilities that go beyond what we would ever offer in Astro core, and gives you the same for video as well.
