We are excited to announce [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/) as a launch partner for Astro Content Layer, our new approach to bringing external CMS content into [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/). Hygraph is an API-first CMS that lets you organize your complex, structured content and build high-performance, content-driven applications with any frontend technology.

Content collections allows you to combine content of various types into a single API. With Content Layer this now includes bringing in content from various external sources, such as Hygraph CMS.

## Using the Hygraph loader

To use the new loader (in beta), first install the `@hygraph/hygraph-astro-loader` package:

```shell
npm install @hygraph/hygraph-astro-loader
```

In the Hygraph dashboard, find the endpoint of your API and copy the URL and provide it as an environment variable, naming it something like `HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT`.

Then import and use the loader inside of your `src/content/config.ts` configuration file:

```ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { HygraphLoader } from '@hygraph/hygraph-astro-loader';

const pages = defineCollection({
  loader: HygraphLoader({
    endpoint: import.meta.env.HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT,
    operation: 'pages',
    fields: ["id", "title", "slug", { "body": ["text"] }],
  }),

  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    title: z.string({
      required_error: 'Title is required'
    }).min(1, {
      message: 'Title is required to be at least 1 character'
    }),
    slug: z.string(),
    body: z.object({
      text: z.string(),
    }),
  })
})

export const collections = { pages }
```

And that's it, from here you can query and use collections the same way you would for local collections. See the Astro docs on [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Also check out yesterday's [deep dive](/blog/content-layer-deep-dive/) on Content Layer to learn how loaders work, and how you can build your own. Also check out the Hygraph loader's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hygraph/hygraph-astro-loader) to report issues and contribute.
