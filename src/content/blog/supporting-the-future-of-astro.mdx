On Friday we announced [The Astro Technology Company is joining Cloudflare](/blog/joining-cloudflare/)!
With this news out of the bag, let’s talk about Astro’s path to a sustainable future.

## How Astro is funded

In 2021, The Astro Technology Company [raised some money](/blog/the-astro-technology-company/) to support the development of Astro and work on growing a business around the framework.
This gave Astro two ways to fund our development:

1. A company aligned with Astro’s vision
2. An open source model of sponsors and partners

This has been a huge success.
To date, we have been able to disperse more than $500,000 in open source sponsorships to Astro’s maintainers and community.

More than half of Astro’s core maintainers are community contributors, and Astro is what it is today because we have been able to support their work financially.

Thank you to Astro’s [sponsors](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild), [agency partners](/agencies/), [theme sponsors](/themes/) — and [merch purchasers!](https://shop.astro.build/) — for making this possible.
Building Astro is a community effort, and we couldn’t have done it without you.

Today, this hasn’t changed.
Full-time employees of The Astro Technology Company are now employees of Cloudflare and will continue to work on Astro full-time.
The contributions of other core maintainers will continue to be supported by sponsorships.

## How you can help

Sponsorships have paid for maintainers to:

- Lead Astro’s [documentation efforts](https://docs.astro.build/)
- Develop [Starlight](http://starlight.astro.build/)
- Add [font optimization](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/fonts/) support to Astro
- Design [type-safe environment variables](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables)
- Manage docs [translations across 14 languages](/blog/astro-i18n/)
- Maintain our [theme portal](/themes/) and [integration catalog](/integrations/)
- Grow our vibrant [Discord community](/chat)
- Publish our [monthly newsletter](https://buttondown.com/withastro/archive/)
- Plan [Astro 6](/blog/astro-6-beta/)
- Fix sooooo many bugs
- …and much more!

In addition, sponsorships have allowed us to support vital contributions to the Astro ecosystem like [Volar](https://volarjs.dev/), [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/), and [ESLint support](https://github.com/ota-meshi/eslint-plugin-astro).

Help us build the web you want to see!
