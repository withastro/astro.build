We are excited to welcome [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/) as a new official sponsoring partner of the Astro project, in coordination with their launch of the new [Stainless Docs Platform](https://www.stainless.com/products/docs) powered by Astro!

Stainless is already the go-to platform for teams building high-quality, easy-to-use APIs. Stainless generates robust SDKs directly from your API spec, and then keeps them up-to-date for you automatically, across every language. With today's launch of the [Stainless Docs Platform](https://www.stainless.com/products/docs) (Early Access), you now also get a beautiful documentation site for your SDKs and APIs that automatically stays up-to-date with your spec. By choosing Astro, Stainless ensures that every docs site they generate is fast, accessible, deploys anywhere, and dead-simple to maintain.

		Because the Stainless Docs Platform builds on the strong foundations provided by Astro, developers get great DX, extensibility, and the ability to deploy anywhere. For end users, the generated sites feel great and load near instantly. We couldn’t be more excited to be the newest members of the Astro community.

## Instant docs for APIs & SDKs

Stainless Docs integrates into your codebase as a single Astro integration. Once setup, it adds complete prose, API, and SDK reference documentation to your docs site, automatically. 

Internally, it builds on top of [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), Astro’s official documentation theme. Starlight is the [fast](https://x.com/astrodotbuild/status/1979138579751174498) and flexible docs framework already used by Cloudflare, Google, GitHub, GitLab, Microsoft, Netlify, OpenAI, WPEngine, and countless others. As Stainless began building on top of Starlight, they realized that they could extract their work into a single Astro integration, removing the indirect dependency on Starlight without losing any of the the power of Starlight's built-in component library, search experience, and extreme flexibility in customization. 

Read the full [launch post](https://www.stainless.com/blog/stainless-docs-early-access) from Stainless to learn more about the Stainless Docs Platform. In the coming months, Stainless will also be releasing a standalone Starlight plugin that adds API/SDK reference pages to any existing Starlight website, for developers looking to integrate Stainless Docs Platform into an existing docs site.

## Astro ❤️ Stainless

We're grateful to the entire Stainless team for their support of Astro. The sponsorship funding will be invested directly into the open-source project to support the long-term maintenance of Astro, benefiting everyone. You can learn more about how we use these funds in our [FUNDING.md](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/FUNDING.md) on GitHub.

Thank you, Stainless!
