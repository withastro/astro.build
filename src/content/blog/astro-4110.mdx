**Astro 4.11 is out with custom 500 page improvements and Shiki transformers in the Code component.**

Learn more on each of these:

- [**Improvements to `500.astro`**](#improvements-to-500astro)
- [**Shiki transfomers in the `<Code />` component**](#shiki-transfomers-in-the-code-component)

To upgrade an existing project, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. Alternatively, upgrade manually by running the upgrade command for your package manager:

```sh
# Recommended:
npx @astrojs/upgrade

# Manual:
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro --latest
yarn upgrade astro --latest
```

## Improvements to 500.astro

[`src/pages/500.astro`](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#custom-500-error-page) is a special page file in Astro that allows you to handle [500](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) errors gracefully. A 500 error most commonly happens where there is a bug in your application; such as not wrapping delicate code in a `try/catch`. When component code throws, Astro catches and returns a 500 response. If you have `src/pages/500.astro` this page gets rendered into the response body.

New in 4.11, `500.astro` now receives the `error` as a prop. This allows you to give more contextual information about the error.

```astro
---
interface Props {
  error: unknown
}
const { error } = Astro.props
---

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Server error - Custom 500</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Server error</h1>
	<p>{error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Shiki transfomers in the Code component

Astro's built-in [`<Code />` component](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#code-) is used to render syntax highlighted code blocks inside of Astro pages. The component uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) and supports all popular themes and languages. Now, you can also use [Shiki transformers](https://shiki.style/packages/transformers#shikijs-transformers) on the code blocks by passing the `transformers` prop:

```astro
---
import { transformerNotationFocus } from '@shikijs/transformers'
import { Code } from 'astro:components'
const code = `const foo = 'hello'
const bar = ' world'
console.log(foo + bar) // [!code focus]
`
---
<Code {code} lang="js" transformers={[transformerNotationFocus()]} />
<style is:global>
  pre.has-focused .line:not(.focused) {
    filter: blur(1px);
  }
</style>
```
