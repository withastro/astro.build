A month full of releases, Astro DB, Astro Developer Portal, and so much more. Let's dive in!

## Updates from Mission Control

- [Astro DB](https://astro.build/db/) is now available in early preview! 🚀
- We launched the all new [Astro Developer Portal](/blog/dev-portal)! 🎉
- All tests in Astro have been [migrated to `node:test`](/blog/node-test-migration/)

## Releases

- Astro [4.5](https://astro.build/blog/astro-450/)
- The first release of [`astro:db`](/blog/astro-db-deep-dive/)
- Starlight [0.21](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/releases/tag/%40astrojs%2Fstarlight%400.21.0)

## Docs

This month, we added a new [Upgrade Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/upgrade-astro/) page to the docs that includes how to upgrade to the latest version, past upgrade guides and docs for older versions, as well as an explanation of Astro's semantic versioning from our platform team. If you ever wondered what all the different numbers in our release versions meant, we've now
got you covered!

Our weekly Discord call “Talking and Doc’ing” is a chance for you to watch Team Docs work in public, jump in a shared Codespace or Gitpod Workspace, and contribute to the docs live, together. This month’s topics included:

- Updating our [community website](https://community.astro.build) with all of our past community award winners going back to the very beginning, giving us a chance to test a new pagination component.
- Adding our new `<Steps />` component to the entire Build a Blog beginner tutorial.
- Helping a brand new Astro-community tips and resource site figure out how to get started with Starlight. Check out [astro-tips.dev](https://astro-tips.dev) for recipes and more!

## Community

Astro wouldn’t be what it is without its community. From Discord support, to documentation improvements, to translations, to code contributions, Astro welcomes it all.
