We're excited to announce the launch of the **[Astro Agency Partner Program](/agencies/)** — a new initiative connecting you with expert Astro agencies, while supporting the ongoing development of the Astro open source project.

As Astro continues to grow in the enterprise space, we've seen an increasing demand for professional development services from businesses looking to use the power and performance of Astro in their projects. At the same time, we've watched a vibrant ecosystem of agencies specializing in Astro emerge and flourish.

The Astro Agency Partner Program brings these together, making it easier for businesses to find the right Astro expertise, while providing valuable resources and recognition to agencies committed to the Astro ecosystem. At the same time, it allows agencies to support the open source project that powers their work.

## What's included

We first reached out to the Astro community in January 2025 to gauge interest in an agency partner program. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and we received a lot of great feedback on what agencies would like to see from such a program. We have designed the program to meet the needs of both agencies and businesses.

At launch, the Astro Agency Partner Program includes:

- **[Agency Directory](/agencies/)** — A curated list of agencies specializing in Astro development, making it simple for businesses to find the perfect partner for their projects.
- **Lead Generation** — Agencies in the program will receive qualified leads from the Astro team and other partners, helping them connect with businesses looking for Astro development services. This is a great way for agencies to grow their Astro client base and showcase their expertise.
- **Recognition** — Official partner status with the Astro project, including badges for agency websites and marketing materials. These agencies are recognized as trusted partners in the Astro ecosystem.
- **Exclusive Resources** — Access to specialized resources and a direct line to the Astro team to help agencies enhance their skills, deliver exceptional results to their clients, and influence the future of Astro.
- **Financial Support Model** — A way for agencies to financially contribute to the Astro open source project, ensuring its sustainable development. Supporting the project helps Astro continue to grow and improve, benefiting everyone in the ecosystem.

## Our launch partners

We have been working with a small group of agencies to kick off the program, and are opening it up to more agencies today. Our launch partners are a hand-picked group of agencies from around the world, who have demonstrated a track record in building high-quality Astro sites.

- **[Bejamas](/agencies/bejamas/)**
- **[58agents](/agencies/58agents/)**
- **[Lucky Media](/agencies/lucky-media/)**

Each of these agencies brings unique strengths to the program and has contributed to the Astro ecosystem. We will be announcing more partners soon. [Get in touch](https://astro.build/agencies/join/) if you'd like your agency to be one of them.
