We're excited to announce the launch of the **[Astro Agency Partner Program](/agencies/)** — a new initiative connecting businesses with expert Astro agencies, while supporting the ongoing development of the Astro open source project.

As Astro continues to grow, we've seen an increasing demand for professional development services from businesses looking to use the power and performance of Astro in their projects. At the same time, we've watched a vibrant ecosystem of agencies specializing in Astro emerge and flourish.

The Astro Agency Partner Program bridges this gap, making it easier for businesses to find the right Astro expertise while providing valuable resources and recognition to agencies committed to the Astro ecosystem.

## What's Included

We first reached out to the Astro community in January 2025 to gauge interest in an agency partner program. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and we received a lot of great feedback on what agencies would like to see from such a program. We took that feedback to heart and have designed the program to meet the needs of both agencies and businesses.

The Astro Agency Partner Program includes:

- **[Agency Directory](/agencies/)** — A curated list of agencies specializing in Astro development, making it simple for businesses to find the perfect partner for their projects.
- **Recognition** — Official partner status with the Astro project, including badges for agency websites and marketing materials. These agencies are recognized as trusted partners in the Astro ecosystem.
- **Exclusive Resources** — Access to specialized resources and a direct line to the Astro team to help agencies enhance their skills and deliver exceptional results to their clients.
- **Financial Support Model** — A way for agencies to financially contribute to the Astro open source project, ensuring its sustainable development. Supporting the project helps Astro continue to grow and improve, benefiting everyone in the ecosystem.

## Our Launch Partners

The response to our survey was overwhelming, and we have been working with a small group of agencies to kick off the program. These are a hand-picked group of agencies from around the world, who have demonstrated a track record in building high-quality Astro sites.

- **[Bejamas](/agencies/bejamas/)**
- **[58agents](/agencies/58agents/)**
- **[Lucky Media](/agencies/lucky-media/)**
- **[EXDST](/agencies/exdst/)**

Each of these agencies brings unique strengths to the program and has contributed significantly to the Astro ecosystem. We will be announcing more partners soon. [Get in touch](https://astro.build/agencies/join/) if you're interested in joining the program.

## Why This Matters

This program represents a win for everyone in the Astro community:

- **For Businesses**: Find pre-vetted Astro experts who can deliver exceptional results
- **For Agencies**: Get qualified leads, gain official recognition and grow your Astro expertise.
- **For the Open Source Project**: Secure sustainable financial support to continue development
- **For the Community**: Benefit from a stronger ecosystem and continued innovation

## Looking Ahead

The Agency Partner Program is just the beginning. As we grow, we'll be expanding the program to include more partners, additional resources, and deeper integration between Astro development and agency services.

We believe that by strengthening the connection between agencies and the core project, we can accelerate innovation, improve the developer experience, and deliver even more value to businesses building with Astro.
