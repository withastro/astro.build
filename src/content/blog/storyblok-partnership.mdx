We are thrilled to announce [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/?utm_campaign=devex&utm_source=astro&utm_medium=blog) as Astro's official CMS partner, donating **$2,500** each month towards the ongoing open source maintenance and development of Astro.

**To celebrate, Storyblok is releasing the official [@storyblok/astro](https://www.storyblok.com/mp/announcing-storyblok-astro) integration.** This new integration makes it even easier to connect Storyblok and Astro together with minimal developer configuration and setup required. Read [the official announcement post](https://www.storyblok.com/mp/announcing-storyblok-astro) to learn more.

Storyblok is the headless content management system (CMS) that empowers 86,000+ developers and content teams around the world to create better content experiences across the web. Pair Astro with Storyblok's [newly released V2 CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/mp/v2) to create faster websites using the tools your developers already love.

Here's what Manuel Schröder at Storyblok had to say about Astro:

		Astro is the ideal choice for content-driven websites, where fast load times and responsiveness
		truly matter. Building your website with Astro results in a much-improved UX while also
		providing a fantastic DX for new and experienced developers alike. At Storyblok, we are certain
		that it will have a big impact on the web development community and could not be happier about
		our partnership.
