We are thrilled to announce that [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_campaign=devex-jl&utm_source=astro&utm_medium=blog) has become Astro's first corporate sponsor and official hosting partner, donating [$2,500 each month](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild) towards the ongoing open source maintenance and development of Astro.

Netlify is the company responsible for kicking off the modern [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) movement. Today, their hosting + serverless platform is loved by developers around the world. [Astro](https://astro.build/) can build you a blazing-fast website, but you'll always need a great host like Netlify to deliver that snappy experience to your users.

Here's what Jason told us about Astro:

<Testimonial>
	<Icon slot="logo" name="logos/netlify" height="48" class="invert" />
	<span slot="quote">
		Astro is tackling an extremely hard problem: **how do we keep the advantages of powerful
		frameworks but stop making end users pay the cost of developer experience?** Shipping only HTML
		and CSS for the vast majority of web content that doesn't need to be dynamic and only including
		JavaScript when it's actually necessary is a huge win for developers and users alike.

</Testimonial>

Astro is honored and excited to have Netlify as our first official corporate sponsor. We are grateful for the support of Jason Lengstorf, Cassidy Williams, and the entire Netlify team for their help and evangelism. It's because of support from companies like Netlify that we are able to receive ongoing maintenance and keep developing Astro in an open, financially-sustainable way.

Our first integration with Netlify will be to add the ["Deploy with Netlify"](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/11/29/introducing-the-deploy-to-netlify-button/) button to our official Astro starter templates. This will make it even easier to create new, hosted Astro websites in just a few clicks. Check out all of our batteries-included starter templates in the brand new [Astro Theme Showcase.](https://astro.build/themes)

Thanks, Netlify!
