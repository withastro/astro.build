**🌟 Starlight 0.35 wants to be your summer icon with a release that makes customizing your docs easier than ever.**

Let’s dive into the highlights from this release:

- [**Custom icons in asides**](#custom-icons-in-asides)
- [**Custom attributes for autogenerated sidebar links**](#custom-attributes-for-autogenerated-sidebar-links)
- [**Custom page slug processing**](#custom-page-slug-processing)

To upgrade an existing Starlight site, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. This will update Starlight, Astro, and any other integrations you are using:

```sh
npx @astrojs/upgrade
```

## Custom icons in asides

Starlight’s [asides](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#asides) make it easy to add styled notes, warnings, and other kinds of callouts to your docs pages.
Starlight 0.35 takes this one step further, allowing you to override an aside’s icon.

<video
	autoplay
	loop
	muted
	playsinline
	class="mx-auto w-full max-w-full rounded-lg border border-astro-gray-500"
	aria-label="Animation of a Starlight tip aside cycling between different icons."
	role="img"
	src={AsideIcons}
></video>

Add an `icon` attribute to your aside to customize the icon, with support across Markdown, MDX, and Markdoc pages:

```md title="example.md" 'icon="heart"'
:::tip{icon="heart"}
Show your love with a heart icon.
:::
```

```mdx title="example.mdx" 'icon="heart"'
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="tip" icon="heart">
	Show your love with a heart icon.
</Aside>
```

```md title="example.mdoc" 'icon="heart"'
{% aside type="tip" icon="heart" %}
Show your love with a heart icon.
{% /aside %}
```

Currently, asides can be styled using [Starlight’s built-in icons](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/icons/), but we’re planning to expand this to include [custom icon support](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/pull/3024) in a future release.

Thank you to [Shubham Padia](https://github.com/shubham-padia) who contributed this feature!

## Custom attributes for autogenerated sidebar links

Starlight 0.35 adds support for applying custom HTML attributes to all links in an autogenerated sidebar group.
This makes it easier to add a custom style or behavior to all links in part of your sidebar.

Use the new [`autogenerate.attrs`](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#custom-html-attributes-for-autogenerated-links) option in your sidebar configuration to add custom attributes.
For example, you could decide to italicize all links in a specific autogenerated group:

```js {9-10}
starlight({
	title: 'My docs',
	sidebar: [
		{
			label: 'Constellations',
			autogenerate: {
				// Autogenerate a group of links for the 'constellations' directory.
				directory: 'constellations',
				// Italicize all link labels in this group.
				attrs: { style: 'font-style: italic' },
			},
		},
	],
}),
```

## Custom page slug processing

It’s now easier to customize how your docs file names are mapped to URLs.

By default, Astro uses the popular [`github-slugger`](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger) package to normalize content file names.
For example, the content in `Example.File.md` is served at `/examplefile`.
This ensures consistent output and URL compatibility with many common platforms.

However, if you need to customize this normalization, you can now pass a [`generateId`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#generateid) option to Starlight’s `docsLoader()` in your content configuration.
The following example avoids all normalization and just strips the file extensions from content files:

```js {9-10}
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { docsLoader } from '@astrojs/starlight/loaders';
import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema';

export const collections = {
	docs: defineCollection({
		loader: docsLoader({
			// Remove the `.md` or `.mdx` extension, but otherwise don’t process filenames.
			generateId: ({ entry }) => entry.split('.').slice(0, -1).join('.'),
		}),
		schema: docsSchema(),
	}),
};
```

## Bug fixes and more

As always, we’ve also been working to fix issues and extend existing features. The [Starlight changelog](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/CHANGELOG.md) lists all the details including migration guidance for breaking changes.

Here are a few of the bigger changes in 0.35:

### Markdown plugins now limited to docs content

Markdown content outside of Starlight’s `src/content/docs/` collection is no longer processed by Starlight’s default remark and rehype plugins.
This improves compatibility with sites using Markdown content in non-Starlight pages.

If you were relying on the previous behavior, we’d love to hear from you!
Please open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/new/choose) to let us know your use case.

### Banner content is now excluded from search results

Content added using Starlight’s [`banner`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/#banner) frontmatter property is no longer indexed by Pagefind.
This fixes some unexpected behavior in the search modal.
