2023 was a huge year for Astro, and 2024 is already shaping up to be even bigger. Let's dive into the updates!

## Updates from Mission Control

- We have a [new channel on Discord](/chat) `#dev-integrations`, a new home for anyone building their own Astro integrations.
- Starlight was nominated for a Product Hunt [open-source Golden Kitty Award](https://www.producthunt.com/golden-kitty-awards/hall-of-fame?year=2023#open-source).
- We launched [The Official Astro Newsletter](/newsletter/signup). Sign up if you want to stay updated on all things happening in the Astrosphere!
- Never want to miss an Astro event? [Subscribe to our Astro Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_g6re3u5gkl0mug3ktn1dibqhfk%40group.calendar.google.com).

## Releases

The first month of the year has already started strong with minor releases from both Astro and Starlight 💪!

- [Astro 4.1](https://astro.build/blog/astro-4/)
- [Astro 4.2](https://astro.build/blog/astro-420/) 
- [Starlight 0.16](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/releases/tag/%40astrojs%2Fstarlight%400.16.0) 
- [Starlight 0.17](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/releases/tag/%40astrojs%2Fstarlight%400.17.0)

## Docs

New this month in both Astro and Starlight docs: dedicated sidebar sections with pages for community content and resources.

You'll find links to tutorials, blog posts, community recipes, videos and streams. Check out the [community-produced content about Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/community-resources/content/), and the growing list of [Starlight content](https://starlight.astro.build/resources/community-content/). Catch up on some of the classic [talks, interviews, and streams](https://docs.astro.build/en/community-resources/talks/) you might have missed.

Open a PR with a link to your own recipes in the appropriate categories and help the Astro community add new features and functionality to their own sites!

Our weekly Discord call "Talking and Doc'ing" is a chance for you to watch Team Docs work in public, jump in a shared Codespace or Gitpod Workspace, and contribute to the docs live, together. This month's topics included:

- **Team Docs quarterly planning.** We brainstormed ideas, decided our goals, and broke down projects into sprints.
- **Building a new `<ReadMore />` component.** Everyone on the call then jumped in the code base to help find and replace all occurrences of our old "emoji + See more at this link" pattern.
- **Taking [Lunaria](https://lunaria.dev/), and its documentation, for a test drive.** We built a Starlight site from scratch, then everyone on the call added new languages and various pages so we would have translation statuses to track. Then we installed Lunaria and finished the call with a new i18n site, complete with translation tracking!
- **File/URL structure organization.** Soon, the URLs for all our pages will actually correspond to the section in the sidebar in which they live. How did we not break anything with 12 people in the codebase, moving files around and updating links all at once? 🫣
