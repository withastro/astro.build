I am thrilled to announce that [Webflow](https://webflow.com/?utm_source=Astro&utm_medium=tech-partner&utm_campaign=fy26-astro&utm_content=fy26-blog-post) has made a **$150,000 donation** to support Astro as our latest official sponsoring partner. In addition, Webflow just announced that they have chosen Astro to power their upcoming AI app gen capabilities, and we couldn't be more excited to be working together with them.

Webflow is the AI-native Website Experience Platform that empowers teams to visually build, manage, and optimize stunning websites that offer both the consumer experience customers expect and the enterprise-grade performance and scale they need.

## Webflow Cloud

[Webflow Cloud](https://webflow.com/feature/cloud?utm_source=Astro&utm_medium=tech-partner&utm_campaign=fy26-astro&utm_content=fy26-blog-post) extends the power of Webflow's platform by deploying full-stack web apps and dynamic, on-brand web experiences alongside your Webflow site. It launched earlier this year with support for the JavaScript & React ecosystem via both Astro and Next.js.

With Astro on Webflow Cloud, you can combine visual site building with code to build dynamic site experiences—booking engines, pricing calculators, customer portals, dashboards, and more—while also achieving the performance and developer experience that Astro is known for, all from within Webflow.

Webflow Cloud runs on Cloudflare's global edge network, which means that developers also benefit from Astro's battle-tested support for Cloudflare via our official deployment adapter. 


## Coming Soon: AI Code Gen, Powered by Astro

But that's not all. At Webflow Conf today, Webflow's CEO Linda Tong and Co-Founder Vlad Magdalin announced Webflow's latest AI evolution: an AI-powered code gen tool that lets users build production-ready web apps and reusable code components from a single prompt. And then chose Astro to power it. 

**Coming soon, all apps built by Webflow AI on their platform will be powered by Astro.** That's a lot of new Astro developers!

We love this pairing. It means that all AI-generated apps on Webflow will benefit from Astro's proven foundation—fast by default, accessible, and easy to scale. Our focus on developers building content-driven websites makes Astro a perfect fit for this use case. Learn more and apply for early access to [Webflow's code generation beta](https://webflow.com/feature/code-gen?utm_source=Astro&utm_medium=tech-partner&utm_campaign=fy26-astro&utm_content=fy26-blog-post) to build Astro web apps and code components with Webflow AI.

We can't wait to share more about this exciting new platform in the coming months.


## Astro ❤️ Webflow

We're grateful to the entire Webflow team for their support of Astro. This sponsorship funding will be invested directly into the open-source project to support the long-term maintenance of Astro, benefiting everyone. You can learn more about how we use these funds in our [FUNDING.md](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/FUNDING.md) on GitHub.

Thank you, Webflow!
