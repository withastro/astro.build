I am thrilled to announce that [Webflow](#TODO) has made a $150,000 donation to support Astro as our new official sponsoring partner. In addition, Webflow just announced that they have chosen Astro to power their new AI AppGen platform coming later this year, and we couldn't be more excited to be working together going forward.

[Webflow](#TODO) is a visual web development platform that empowers designers, marketers, and businesses to build, launch, and scale responsive, production‑ready websites—without writing code. 

## Webflow Cloud for Astro

Webflow Cloud is Webflow's new serverless hosting platform that lets teams run full-stack, on-brand web experiences natively within Webflow. Webflow Cloud debuted earlier this year with framework support for Astro as one of two supported options (alongside Next.js).

Webflow Cloud with Astro lets you build dynamic site experiences -- like booking engines, pricing calculators, customer portals, dashboards and more -- with the flexibility of code and the best-in-class performance + developer experience that Astro is known for.

Webflow Cloud runs on Cloudflare's global edge network, which means that developers will also benefit from Astro's first-class support for Cloudflare via our official Cloudflare deployment adapter. 


## Coming Soon: Webflow AppGen AI

But that's not all. At Webflow Conf earlier today, TODO announced Webflow's latest AI platform updates. TODO sentance about what it is.

**Soon, all apps built by Webflow AI on their platform will be built using Astro.** That's a lot of new Astro developers!

More seriously, we love this pairing. This means that all Webflow AppGen AI sites will stand to benefit from the 5+ years of reliability that Astro provides as one of JavaScript's most popular web frameworks. And even existing Astro developers outside of Webflow will benefit as our ecosystem continues to grow. 

## Astro ❤️ Webflow

We are so grateful to the entire Webflow team for their support for Astro. The new sponsorship funding will be invested directly into the open-source project to support the long-term maintenance of Astro, benefiting everyone. You can learn more about how we use these funds by reading our [FUNDING.md](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/FUNDING.md) document on GitHub.

Thank you, Webflow!
