## Community

Astro wouldn’t be what it is without its community. From Discord support, to documentation improvements, to translations, to code contributions, Astro welcomes it all.

### Discord Updates

There's a new dedicated `#themes` channel to discuss Astro theme design and development! Share your ideas and techniques for building flexible themes. Ask for opinions and advice from fellow theme designers. All things themes! 🎨

And don't forget to check out [this month's new themes](#themes--templates) while you're at it!

### New Community-run Support Forum

Although we're proud of the welcoming, inclusive community environment we've created on Discord, not everyone in the Astroverse is active there. Some people aren't on Discord by choice. Some geographic regions make accessing Discord difficult. This can create issues getting the Astro support you need.

Our volunteer Support *Squad* may be in Discord, but the [Support *Squid*](https://get.supportsquid.ink/) is swimming in the open waters of the web! This is a brand new community initiative by some of our active Support Patrol members to help extend our support efforts and make questions and answers easier to find in web searches. We hope it's another place you can connect with other astronauts as you build with Astro. 🦑

### Astro Team News

We are pleased to welcome our newest Astro maintainer [@ArmandPhilippot](https://astro.badg.es/contributor/ArmandPhilippot/)!

Merci et bienvenue, astronaut! 🫡
