**CSP got more goodies, and you can serve the CSP using your preferred adapter!**

Astro 5.11 is a small minor that ships with new CSP features, and the ability to disable HTML streaming when using the Node.js adapter

- [**CSP with adapters**](#experimental-live-content-collections)
- [**Opt out from streaming**](#responsive-images-are-now-stable)

To upgrade an existing project, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. Alternatively, upgrade manually by running the upgrade command for your package manager:

```sh
# Recommended:
npx @astrojs/upgrade

# Manual:
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro --latest
yarn upgrade astro --latest
```

## CSP with adapters

Up until now, static pages could serve the CSP header only via element `<meta http-equiv="content-security-poligy">`. This is an inconvenience for some users, because some CSP directives such as `report-uri`, `frame-ancestors`, and `sandbox` don't work when they are served using the `<meta>` element.

From Astro 5.11.0, the adapters `@astrojs/node`, `@astro/netlify` and `@astro/vercel` can now serve the CSP header for static pages using the `Response` headers, allowing to support all directives.

This is a new feature that users can opt in using the new adapter option called `experimentalStaticHeaders`.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={10}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import node from "@astrojs/node";

export default defineConfig({
    experimental: {
        csp: true
    },
    adapter: node({
        mode: "standalone",
        experimentalStaticHeaders: true
    })
})
```

Each adapter will use the hosting platform capabilities to enable this feature:
- Netlify will use the [framework API](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks-api/#headers)
- Vercel will use the [project configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#headers)
- Node.js will use an internal implementation

We will soon ship support for Cloudflare too, which will use the [`_headers` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/).

Under the hood, the adapters leverage a new adapter feature called [`experimentalStaticHeaders`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/adapter-reference/#experimentalstaticheaders). If you're an adapter developer, you can now provide full CSP capabilities to your users.

## Opt out from streaming

The `@astrojs/node` adapter can be configured to disable [HTML streaming](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#html-streaming) for on demand pages with the new option `experimentalDisableStreaming`.

HTML streaming helps with performance and generally provides a better visitor experience. In most cases, disabling streaming is not recommended.

However, when you need to disable HTML streaming (e.g. your host only supports non-streamed HTML caching at the CDN level), you can now opt out of the default behavior:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={7}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import node from '@astrojs/node';

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: node({
    mode: 'standalone',
    experimentalDisableStreaming: true
  })
});
```

## Bug fixes

As always, we've been working hard on fixing issues since the [5.11 release](/blog/astro-590). See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for all the details.
