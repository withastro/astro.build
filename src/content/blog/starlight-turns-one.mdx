Happy Birthday, Starlight!

One year ago today we released the initial v0.1 of [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)â€”everything we know about building docs, wrapped up in an easy-to-use template.

We launched this early preview with built-in site search, generated navigation, i18n, a11y, seo, clean typography, code highlighting, dark mode, "edit in GitHub", MDX and Markdoc support. In the past year, we've added so much more.

We focused on bringing you even more built-in components that are essential to a docs project. And thanks to our global community of contributors, we are proud to offer a translated docs infrastructure in sixteen officially supported languages, out of the box.

Our goal has always been to provide sensible defaults so that you can just add Markdown content and you have functional, fast, lightweight, delightful docs. It has been so rewarding to see how many people have adopted Starlight for their own docs... how many people even *have* docs *because* of Starlight!

It's also been exciting to see how you have customized Starlight, and demonstrated that Starlight works for everyone from the smallest open-source packages to large, enterprise projects, and everyone in between.

Starlight shows what a team of developers passionate about docs can do, and we are thankful that so many of you joined us, brought your passion, and made Starlight even more than we hoped it would be.

See the full talk at Astro Together describing Starlight's first year, and join us on the road to our next milestone: v1.0 later this year! We're happy to have you aboard!
