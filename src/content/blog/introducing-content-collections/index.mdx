description: "New in Astro 2.0: Content Collections deliver a better developer experience for working with local content like Markdown and MDX. Powered by TypeScript, your local content is now automatically typed and validated for you against a schema so that you never miss or misspell another frontmatter property name again."

import BlogContentImage from "/src/components/BlogContentImage.astro"
// Images
import bannerErrorOverlayOld from "./banner-error-overlay-old.png"
import bannerErrorOverlay from "./banner-error-overlay.jpg"
// Videos
import contentDemo from "./_content-demo.mp4"
import dataDemo from "./_data-demo.mp4"

**Working with Markdown/MDX is hard.** Maintaining consistent data across hundreds or even thousands of pieces of local content -- blog posts, newsletters, etc. -- gets more and more difficult as your site grows.

Content is an essential piece of the web, so why are we content (pun _intended_) with a sub-par developer experience? Astro's mission has always been to help developers fast, content-focused websites... accepting this challenge was a no-brainer.

Astro 2.0 introduces the **Content Collections API:** a new way to work with local Markdown and MDX. Content collections help you manage your local content with built-in type safety, out-of-the-box. It's our most exciting release by far, and it's available for you to try today.

## TypeScript for your Markdown

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
	<source src={dataDemo} type="video/mp4" />
	Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

Content collections work by organizing local content into "collections" inside of the project `src/content` directory. This is a special directory where similar Markdown and MDX files can be grouped together (ex: `blog/`, `docs/`, `newsletter/`, etc).

Built-in query functions provide hints and autocomplete as you type. Fetch and render your content to HTML inside an Astro component with just a few lines of code:

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
	<source src={contentDemo} type="video/mp4" />
	Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

Everything inside of a collection is type-safe, including your frontmatter. Define your collection with an optional schema, and Astro will ensure that every file has the correct frontmatter with TypeScript types automatically generated for you.

```ts
const blog = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    // Define your expected frontmatter properties
    title: z.string(),
    // Mark certain properties as optional
    draft: z.boolean().optional(),
    // Transform datestrings to full Date objects
    publishDate: z.string().transform((val) => new Date(val))
    // Improve SEO with descriptive warnings
	description: z.string().max(160, 'Short descriptions have better SEO!')
    // ...
  }),
});
```

This magic is thanks to [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), a powerful validation library for TypeScript. Using Zod's expressive schema builder, you can ensure important properties like `title` are always present and correctly typed. When you get something wrong, Zod provides helpful error messages on everything from missing properties to important SEO suggestions.

## Better errors for everyone

<BlogContentImage src={bannerErrorOverlayOld} alt="" />

Imagine that you're developing your website until suddenly… BOOM! Your dev environment stops with this error. What happened?

If you answered “a random file was missing its expected `title` in its frontmatter,” congratulations! You're the world's first JS psychic. But if you're like the rest of us, hunting down this bug will probably involve some stack-traces, trial-and-error, a few noisy `console.log` statements, and just a bit of luck.

Now, lets see that same error in Astro 2.0:

<BlogContentImage src={bannerErrorOverlay} alt="" />

The first thing you'll notice is that Astro 2.0's redesigned error overlay. But more importantly, the information has become far more detailed. The exact filename of the offending file is surfaced immediately. A snippet from the file is included to help you understand the problem, along with a link to open that file directly in your code editor. As a nice bonus, docs hints are included to help you debug your issue.

## Getting started with Content Collections

There's plenty more to explore with content collections, available today in Astro 2.0. You can [head to our content collections guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to get started, and explore our revamped [**blog**](https://astro.new/blog), [**docs**](https://astro.new/docs), and [**portfolio**](https://astro.new/portfolio) starters to see content collections in action.

We also welcome your feedback as we expand the content collections featureset. We thank everyone involved in the content collections RFC, and invite you all to propose future ideas in our new [public roadmap](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap).
