- [Tilly](https://www.tilly.social/en/) hosts its marketing site, offline-capable PWA, and API routes together in one Astro project. Tilly is an open-source personal relationship manager with client-side sync, offline-first design, and optional agentic AI assistance... and the entire React app is its own Astro island! ([source](https://github.com/ccssmnn/tilly))
- No missing pieces in this set! Take a break and put some puzzles together at [Jigsaw King](https://www.jigsawking.com/). Sound on for those satisfying "clicks" when pieces fit together!
- Astro is perfect for your content sites, and both [MiniNote](https://mininote.app/) and [Online Notes](https://onlinenotes.net) want to help you organize your thoughts with these online digital notetaking apps created with Astro.
