Astro 1.5.0 just went out and it features:

- **[Adapter support for `astro preview`](#adapter-support-for-astro-preview)**: Adapters can now support `astro preview`.
- **[Standalone mode in Node.js adapter](#standalone-mode-in-nodejs-adapter)**: The Node.js adapter now can build to a standalone server.
- **[HMR for Tailwind and TypeScript config](#hmr-for-tailwind-and-typescript-config)**: The dev server will now automatically reload on Tailwind config and tsconfig changes.
- **[API Endpoint improvements](#api-endpoint-improvements)**: The API route `APIContext` object now matches the Astro global more closely.
- **[Astro.redirect status code](#astroredirect-status-code)**: You can now optionally pass a status code when using `Astro.redirect`.

You can update your projects by running `npm install astro@latest`.

## Adapter support for `astro preview`

We are rolling out support for the `astro preview` command in adapters via a new integration option, starting with the Node.js adapter [@astrojs/node](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/). If you are using `@astrojs/node`, you can now preview your SSR app by running:

```shell
npm run preview
```

### Adapter API

We will be updating the other first party Astro adapters to support preview over time. Adapters can opt-in to this feature by providing the `previewEntrypoint` via the `setAdapter` function in `astro:config:done` hook. The Node.js adapter's code looks like this:

```diff
export default function() {
  return {
    name: '@astrojs/node',
    hooks: {
      'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter, config }) => {
        setAdapter({
          name: '@astrojs/node',
          serverEntrypoint: '@astrojs/node/server.js',
+          previewEntrypoint: '@astrojs/node/preview.js',
          exports: ['handler'],
        });

        // more here
      }
    }
  };
}
```

## Standalone mode in Node.js adapter

New in [@astrojs/node](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) is support for **standalone mode**. With standalone mode, you can start your production server without needing to write any server JavaScript logic yourself. The server starts simply by running the script like so:

```shell
node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

To enable standalone mode, set the new `mode` option to `'standalone'` in your Astro config:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"
import nodejs from "@astrojs/node"

export default defineConfig({
	output: "server",
	adapter: nodejs({
		mode: "standalone",
	}),
})
```

See the [@astrojs/node](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) documentation for all of the options available in standalone mode.

Existing @astrojs/node users who are using their own HTTP server framework such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/) can upgrade by setting the `mode` option to `'middleware'` in order to build to a middleware mode, which is the same behavior and API as before.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"
import nodejs from "@astrojs/node"

export default defineConfig({
	output: "server",
	adapter: nodejs({
		mode: "middleware",
	}),
})
```

## HMR for Tailwind and TypeScript config

HMR is vitally important even at the beginning stages of a project. In a recent Astro release we ensured that changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file resulted in an automatic server restart. Today we are expanding our support for HMR with other configuration files.

Now, editing your [tsconfig.json](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/) settings (for example, to add an alias) results in an HMR update.

Similarly, [Tailwind](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/) configuration file changes now update as well. Just edit your `tailwind.config.(js|cjs|mjs)` file and the changes will reflect without the need to restart your dev server.

We're continuing to focus on HMR and the dev experience in upcoming releases.

## API Endpoint improvements

In API routes, you can now get the `site`, `generator`, `url`, `clientAddress`, `props`, and `redirect` fields on the `APIContext`, which is the first parameter passed to an API route. This was done to make the `APIContext` more closely align with the Astro global in .astro pages.

For example, here's how you might use the `clientAddress`, which is the user's IP address, to selectively allow users.

```ts
export function post({ clientAddress, redirect }) {
	if (!allowList.has(clientAddress)) {
		return redirect("/not-allowed")
	}
}
```

Check out [the docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes) for more information on the newly available fields.

## Astro.redirect status code

New in 1.5 is the ability to pass a status code to `Astro.redirect`. By default it uses `302`, but now you can pass another code as the second argument:

**/src/pages/old-post.astro**

```astro
---
// This page was moved, redirect the user to the new permanent page.
return Astro.redirect("/posts/new-post-name", 301)
---
```
