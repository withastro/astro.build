I am thrilled to announce [Mux](https://www.mux.com?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro&utm_source=astro) as our new **Official Video Partner**. Mux will be sponsoring Astro for $5,000 each month going forward to support the ongoing open source maintenance and development of Astro. 

[Mux](https://www.mux.com?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro&utm_source=astro) is video infrastructure for the web that makes it easy for development teams to ship high-performance and cost-effective video. We see video as a core primitive on the web, so naturally we jumped at the opportunity to partner together to make it even easier for Astro developers to add video to their websites.

		Astro has always impressed me with their focus and commitment to web performance and developer experience. They do so much well, but the best developer experience is when things just work. I'm excited that our partnership means developers using Astro can add high-performance video without sacrificing the speed and simplicity that drew them to Astro in the first place.
