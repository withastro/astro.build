I am thrilled to announce [Mux](https://www.mux.com?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro&utm_source=astro) as our new **Official Video Partner**. Mux will be sponsoring Astro for $5,000 each month going forward to support the ongoing open-source maintenance and development of Astro. Plus, we'll be working closely with them on a few new projects (more below).

[Mux](https://www.mux.com?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro&utm_source=astro) provides video infrastructure for the web that makes it easy for development teams to ship high-performance, cost-effective video. We see video as a core primitive on the web, so naturally we jumped at the opportunity to partner to make it even easier for Astro developers to work with video at scale.

		Astro has always impressed me with their focus and commitment to web performance and developer experience. They do so much well, but the best developer experience is when things just work. I'm excited that our partnership means developers using Astro can add high-performance video without sacrificing the speed and simplicity that drew them to Astro in the first place.

## Astro ❤️ Mux

As part of this partnership, official Astro components for the Mux Player are now available on npm at [@mux/mux-player-astro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mux/mux-player-astro). 

```astro
---
import { MuxPlayer } from "@mux/mux-player-astro";
---
<MuxPlayer
  playbackId="DS00Spx1CV902MCtPj5WknGlR102V5HFkDe"
  metadata={{ video_title: 'My Video' }}
/>
```

We've worked closely with the Mux team to develop this integration and ensure that it's easy to use and works well with Astro. Check out our [new documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/media/mux/) to learn more about these new components and how you can use Mux in any Astro project.

If you need an account, you can get started with Mux for free at [mux.com](https://www.mux.com?utm_campaign=21819274-Astro&utm_source=astro). To celebrate our partnership, new Astro users can get an additional $50 credit at signup by using the code `ASTRO`.

We are so grateful to the entire Mux team for their support for Astro. The new sponsorship funding will be invested directly into the open-source project to support the long-term maintenance of Astro, benefiting everyone. You can learn more about how we use these funds by reading our [FUNDING.md](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/FUNDING.md) document on GitHub.

Thank you, Mux!
