**Astro is giving away $100,000 to support open-source projects in our ecosystem that improve the lives of Astro users everywhere, every day.**

Astro is the web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs, marketing, and e-commerce.  This new Astro Ecosystem Fund will award **$10,000 grants** to ten project maintainers over the next twelve months. Each recipient will receive a one-time grant to support and continue their work on behalf of the larger Astro ecosystem. 

To celebrate the launch, our first three grant recipients have already been selected:

- **[@pilcrowonpaper](https://twitter.com/pilcrowonpaper) — for work on [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) and [Lucia + Astro middleware](https://lucia-auth.com/getting-started/astro/)**  
Lucia is one of the most exciting JavaScript libraries in development right now, not just for Astro but the entire JavaScript ecosystem. Lucia's focus on built-in, first-party support for Astro gives users a complete solution to own their own auth.
- **[@ota-meshi](https://github.com/ota-meshi) — for work on [eslint-plugin-astro](https://github.com/ota-meshi/eslint-plugin-astro)**  
The Astro ESLint plugin has been downloaded over 1,000,000 times and provides essential support for linting `.astro` files alongside the rest of your project.
- **[@Mike_Andreuzza](https://twitter.com/Mike_Andreuzza) — for work on Astro themes & templates**  
Michael (aka [Lexington Themes](https://lexingtonthemes.com/)) is one of the most exciting theme authors in the Astro ecosystem right now, with over 30+ free & premium templates already published to [our catalog](https://astro.build/themes/).

Funding comes from our own open-source sponsorship funds, collected and managed through corporate sponsorship and individual donations. We are thankful to our major open-source sponsors for making this possible: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/), [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/), [and more](https://github.com/withastro/astro#sponsors). Without their support, this initiative would never have been possible.

**Interested in supporting our work? [Sponsor us!](https://www.notion.so/Partner-with-Astro-b05cfd5dcf4248dcbea4a2d81554efed?pvs=21)** 100% of funds raised are invested back into the community.

## From $0 to $200,000

Astro operates as an open-source project. We follow an open governance model, an open roadmap process, and a completely open budgeting process through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild). Our funding is made up entirely of sponsorships and donations to the project, which come from companies and some amazing individuals.

Two years ago we had $0 in our Open Collective. Today, we manage an estimated annual sponsorship budget of $178,374.52 USD with over $200,000 in total funds raised.

Reaching this level of sponsorship didn't happen overnight, and it didn't happen accidentally. Our funding is the result of consistent effort and outreach to large sponsors over the last two years. It's one of the less visible projects within Astro that I'm personally the most proud of.

Early on, a group of us also made the decision to form [The Astro Technology Company](https://astro.build/blog/the-astro-technology-company/). The company provides additional full-time resources to the project, which is another reason why we are able to reserve 100% of our sponsorship for our community of maintainers, contributors, and ecosystem builders.

We don't take this unique privilege lightly. Initiatives like the Astro Ecosystem Fund let us leverage this fortunate position to also give back and support other, less-visible open-source projects in our community.

## Support open-source software

Open-source software is an essential part of the technical foundation that we all benefit from. Every company who uses open-source software to make money should contribute back their support in some way.

We are lucky to have sponsors who understand the importance of this. For example:
- Google dispersed over $2,000,000 through their [Web Framework & Tools Performance Fund](https://opencollective.com/chrome). 
- Sentry recently announced a [$500,000 total contribution to open-source software](https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/?original_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsentry.io%2F) in 2023. 
- Vercel, Netlify, and CloudCannon all sponsor full-time development of popular open-source projects like React, Svelte, Solid.js, and Eleventy. 

[Nicholas Zakas](https://twitter.com/slicknet) (Creator of [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)) has been a huge inspiration for us as well with [his original writing](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2022/06/sponsoring-dependencies-open-source-sustainability/) and [advocacy](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/02/paying-contributors-sponsoring-projects/) for a model of redistribution between open-source projects. Just because we're an open-source project doesn't mean that we can't also share our resources with other,  less visible open-source projects and maintainers. 

The Astro Ecosystem Fund is us putting our money where our mouth is. Every Astro user stands to benefit from the work of these future grant recipients, and we're proud to support them.
