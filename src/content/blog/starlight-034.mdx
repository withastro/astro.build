**üå∏ Blossoms all around me and Starlight is growing too. Let‚Äôs take a look and see what‚Äôs new!**

We‚Äôve been working through our roadmap towards releasing v1 later this year. Here are some highlights from our latest releases:

- [**Built-in heading anchor links**](#heading-anchor-links)
- [**Tailwind v4 support**](#tailwind-v4-support)
- [**CSS cascade layers**](#css-cascade-layers)
- [**Improved `<head>` APIs**](#improved-head-apis)

To upgrade an existing Starlight site, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. This will update Starlight, Astro, and any other integrations you are using:

```sh
npx @astrojs/upgrade
```

## Heading anchor links

Starlight v0.34 adds built-in support for automatically rendering clickable anchor links next to headings in your Markdown, MDX, and Markdoc content.

<Image
	src={AnchorLinks}
	alt="A subheading in the Starlight docs showing a pointer cursor hovering over an anchor link icon."
/>

We built on [accessibility research by Amber Wilson](https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/are-your-anchor-links-accessible/) to design an anchor link approach that aims to be helpful for all users.

Starlight places the link element below the heading in the HTML output and automatically generates an accessible label from your Markdown content. For example, the following Markdown:

```md
## Get started
```

will generate HTML a bit like this:

```html
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<a href="#get-started">Section titled ‚ÄúGet started‚Äù</a>
```

This ensures that headings in the document structure are not cluttered by anchor links and the links themselves still have a clear label available for assistive technology.
We‚Äôve been using this approach in the Astro docs for some time now and are excited to make it available to all sites built with Starlight!

## Tailwind v4 support

Starlight has supported authoring styles with Tailwind CSS since shortly after our first release via a custom Tailwind plugin. We‚Äôve now updated our support for compatibility with Tailwind v4!

## CSS cascade layers

It‚Äôs important that Starlight users can easily customize their sites. Historically, clashes between Starlight‚Äôs built-in styles and a user‚Äôs CSS made the customization experience less smooth than it could have been:

```css
/* Starlight built-in styles (simplified) */
:not(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) + h2 {
	margin-top: 1.5em;
}

/* User styles */
h2 {
	margin-top: 1em; /* ‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt apply because `h2` is a lower specificity! */
}
```

Starlight v0.34 solves conflicts by moving all built-in styles into a dedicated `starlight` [CSS cascade layer](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/). This means that **user styles will always take precedence** over default styles and we can wave goodbye to specificity battles üëã

```css
/* Starlight built-in styles (simplified) */
@layer starlight.content {
	:not(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) + h2 {
		margin-top: 1.5em;
	}
}

/* User styles */
h2 {
	margin-top: 1em; /* ‚úÖ Applies because it‚Äôs in the top layer! */
}
```

This change also means you can enjoy the benefits of using `@layer` to organize your own CSS without Starlight‚Äôs styles always overriding it.

<Note>
	**With great power comes great responsibility!** We recommend checking your
	site‚Äôs appearance when upgrading to make sure there are no style regressions
	caused by this change.
</Note>

## Improved &lt;head&gt; APIs

In Starlight v0.33, we added a new `head` property to our route data object. This unlocks full control over Starlight‚Äôs `<head>` tags in [route middleware](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/#customizing-route-data), including for plugins, allowing you to add tags and filter default tags more easily.

For example, this middleware uses Railway‚Äôs demo [Open Graph image API](https://og.railway.com/) to add `og:image` meta tags to every Starlight page:

```js
// src/routeData.ts
import { defineRouteMiddleware } from '@astrojs/starlight/route-data';

export const onRequest = defineRouteMiddleware((context) => {
	const { entry, head } = context.locals.starlightRoute;

	// Create an Open Graph image URL using the current page‚Äôs title.
	const ogImageUrl = new URL(
		'https://og.railway.com/api/image?fileType=png&layoutName=simple',
	);
	ogImageUrl.searchParams.set('text', entry.data.title);

	// Add a `<meta property="og:image">` tag to the current page‚Äôs `<head>`.
	head.push({
		tag: 'meta',
		attrs: { property: 'og:image', content: ogImageUrl.href },
	});
});
```

## Bug fixes and more

As always, we‚Äôve also been working to fix issues and extend existing features. See the [Starlight changelog](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/CHANGELOG.md) for all the details including migration guidance for breaking changes.
