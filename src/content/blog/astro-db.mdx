For the last year, we’ve been building a fully-managed SQL database platform for Astro. Now anyone can add a hosted database to their Astro project in seconds with everything working out-of-the-box:

- TypeScript ORM, included (Drizzle!)
- Schema management, included
- Schema migrations, included (automatic!)
- Lightweight local development
- Hosted SQL database for production
- Fully integrated into Astro
