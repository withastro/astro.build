## Hacktoberfest

[Hacktober](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is officially over now! Thank you all for your amazing contributions and PRs! Here are some of our statistics:

- 2 Astro core PRs
- 49 Starlight PRs

## Docs

We extended the tutorial with some highly requested features!

- [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-content-collections/)
- [View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-view-transitions/)

"Talking and Doc'ing" is our weekly live Discord call where we involve the community as we work on docs projects! Often we jump into a shared Codespace or HackMD document and everyone can participate. This month's activities included:

- Live reviewing and testing the two new mini-tutorials
- Improving our docs PR template and creating a new GitHub action to welcome first-time contributors
- All hands on deck reviewing translation submissions using the Astro Docs checklist to get everyone's `hacktoberfest-accepted` PRs merged
