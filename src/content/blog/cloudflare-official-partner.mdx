I am thrilled to announce that [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) has made a **$150,000 donation** to support Astro as our latest official hosting partner. This new partnership helps support the overall Astro ecosystem and achieve a more stable deployment experience for anyone choosing to deploy to Cloudflare.

Cloudflare is one of the world's largest networks, powering millions of websites (78 million HTTP requests per second!) with their global network and developer platform. Like Astro, Cloudflare believes in empowering developers with a great developer experience and delivering great performance for the end user. Cloudflare's choice to support our project validates this shared mission and the power of great open source software.

We're investing in Astro because it represents a healthier future for the web. We build on Astro ourselves because it's a return to elegant simplicity that delivers real-world performance, both for our developers and our customers.

## Deploying Astro to Cloudflare

Astro and Cloudflare are a great match for modern web development. For static sites, Cloudflare provides instant deployment behind Cloudflare's best-in-class global CDN. When you need dynamic functionality or a live API, Cloudflare Workers provide a great foundation for Astro's server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. 

You can configure your Astro site to deploy to Cloudflare today with Astro's official Cloudflare adapter, in a single command:

```bash
astro add cloudflare
```

Going forward, we'll be working together with Cloudflare to improve the Astro experience on Cloudflare, starting with an exploration of the new Vite Environment API for better runtime support during development and deployment.

## Astro ❤️ Cloudflare

We're grateful to the entire Cloudflare team for their support of Astro. This sponsorship funding will be invested directly into the open-source project to support the long-term maintenance of Astro, benefiting everyone. You can learn more about how we use these funds in our [FUNDING.md](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/FUNDING.md) on GitHub.

Thank you, Cloudflare!
