Starlight v0.28 is out now! To celebrate, let’s take a look at some of the highlights from recent Starlight releases.

- [On-demand rendering support](#on-demand-rendering-support)
- [Tabs that remember you](#tabs-that-remember-you)
- [Sidebar state persistence](#sidebar-state-persistence)
- [Simpler sidebar configuration](#simpler-sidebar-configuration)

To upgrade an existing project, run the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI from your terminal:

```sh
npx @astrojs/upgrade
```

## On-demand rendering support

Since v0.27, Starlight supports fully dynamic server-side rendering if you need it. Starlight builds fully static sites by default. Set `prerender: false` in the Starlight options to disable static generation of your pages and switch to Astro’s [on-demand rendering mode](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/rendering-modes/):

```diff title="astro.config.mjs" lang="js"
starlight({
	title: 'Docs on Demand',
+	prerender: false,
}),
```

This unlocks the ability to add features like user authentication and personalization to your docs. Check out our [Docs on Demand demo](https://starlight-ssr.netlify.app/) to see some of the possibilities in action. Thanks to [Fryuni](https://github.com/Fryuni) for implementing this feature!

## Tabs that remember you

Starlight’s [`<Tabs>` component](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#tabs) now supports remembering user preferences across page navigations. This lets your reader choose options like their preferred package manager or operating system once, and see that preference reflected elsewhere in your docs. To enable this feature, add matching `syncKey` attributes to your `<Tabs>`:

```mdx title="src/content/docs/example.mdx" /syncKey=".+"/
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
	<TabItem label="npm">npm install @astrojs/starlight</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">pnpm add @astrojs/starlight</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">yarn add @astrojs/starlight</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Sidebar state persistence

Starlight builds on tried and tested web technology, serving simple, server-rendered HTML with minimal JavaScript for optimal performance. We heard user feedback that full-page navigations could be disruptive, because the sidebar state would be lost on each page load.

From v0.26 on, Starlight is able to persist and restore sidebar state across navigations thanks to a lightweight custom element, making for a smoother browsing experience. This is a progressive enhancement — if JavaScript isn’t available on a user’s device, the sidebar renders as usual ensuring a robust experience for all.

## Simpler sidebar configuration

In earlier versions of Starlight, specifying links to internal pages in your [sidebar config](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/) could get a little verbose:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {4-6}
starlight({
	title: 'Old Skool Starlight',
	sidebar: [
		{ label: 'Page one', link: '/one' },
		{ label: 'Page two', link: '/two' },
		// ...
	],
}),
```

With Starlight v0.25, this got a lot simpler. You can now specify just the slug of the page you’re linking to and Starlight will use the page title as the link label automatically:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {4}
starlight({
	title: 'Cutting Edge Starlight',
	sidebar: [
		'one', 'two', // ...
	],
}),
```

As a bonus, with this syntax you get link checking for free — no more accidental 404s! Thanks to [Lorenzo](https://github.com/lorenzolewis) for adding this feature.
