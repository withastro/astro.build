### Astro Team News



### Discord Hot Topics

There was quite the chatter this month about using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with Astro!

People shared multiple guides on how to use Obsidian as a CMS to write and manage your Astro content ([with symlinks](https://lexingtonthemes.com/blog/posts/how-to-use-obsidian-with-astro/), [with GitHub and submodules](https://bryanhogan.com/blog/obsidian-astro-submodule), and [with symlinks and plugins](https://www.mandalivia.com/blog/obsidian-with-astro-for-personal-site/)).

This month we also shared a [Starlight plugin to publish Obsidian vaults](https://starlight-obsidian.vercel.app/), a [Starlight Obsidian theme](https://github.com/Fevol/starlight-theme-obsidian), an [Astro Obsidian content loader](https://github.com/aitorllj93/astro-loader-obsidian) and a [Spaceship Theme](https://github.com/aitorllj93/astro-theme-spaceship) to publish your Obsidian vault to the web with Astro and TailwindCSS.

We even discovered some new video content:
<YouTubeGrid

    { id: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExUZNfAHIP8", title: "How I Use Obsidian Bases for Blog Posts"},
    { id: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhizarvwLnU", title: "Astro Suite for Obsidian"},
    { id: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01svkWUpMfs", title: "Cómo documentar con Obsidian y crear una web con Astro usando Markdown (Directo completo)"},
