## Docs

The Docs team is working hard to migrate the Astro Documentation to Starlight! We have very good news for you! It‚Äôs coming next week!

To help you better contribute, we've added `help - confirm behaviour` and `help - leave feedback` to our list of PR labels to clarify where we need help. Open Issues and PRs have been freshly triaged and there's lots to dive into. 

Our weekly Discord call "Talking and Doc‚Äôing" is a chance for you to watch Team Docs work in public, jump in a codespace, and contribute to the docs. This week's topics included:

- Test driving the new Astro Docs in Starlight
- Reviewing and merging the completed French tutorial
- Rebuilding the [astro.build](http://astro.build) footer so we could link our new community website
- Testing a new Starlight `<Testimonial />` component
- Building the Astro v3 to v4 upgrade guide
