## Docs

The Docs team is working really hard to migrate the Astro Documentation to Starlight! We have very good news for you! It’s coming next week!

We've added `help - confirm behaviour` and `help-leave feedback` to our list of labels on PRs to clarify where we need help. Next to that we have freshly triaged all open issues and PRs.

Our weekly show on Discord called Talking and Doc’ing this month, included:

- Test driving the new Astro Docs in Starlight
- Reviewing and merging the completed French tutorial
- Rebuilding the [astro.build](http://astro.build) footer so we could link our new community website
- Building the Astro v3 to v4 upgrade guide
