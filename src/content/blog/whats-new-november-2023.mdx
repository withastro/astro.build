### Astro 3.6

Three new events now complement the existing¬†`astro:after-swap`¬†and¬†`astro:page-load`¬†events:

```jsx
astro: before - preparation; // Control how the DOM and other resources of the target page are loaded
astro: after - preparation; // Last changes before taking off? Remove that loading indicator? Here you go!
astro: before - swap; // Control how the DOM is updated to match the new page
```

## Docs

The Docs team is working really hard to migrate the Astro Documentation to Starlight! We have very good news for you! It‚Äôs coming next week!

On GitHub, new labels were added to issues and PRs

For issues, you'll still find your old faves `good first issue` and `help wanted`.

But, we've added `help - confirm behaviour` and `help-leave feedback` to our list of labels on PRs.
All our PRs and issues have been freshly triaged, so if you are looking for ways to contribute, now you have even more guidance! If you think there's a label we're missing that would help you better know how you can help, please us know.

We have a new community-led initiative: building a glossary. [See this issue if you want to participate](https://github.com/withastro/docs/issues/5035)

Our weekly show on Discord called Talking and Doc‚Äôing this month, included:

- Test driving the new Astro Docs in Starlight
- Reviewing and merging the completed French tutorial
- Rebuilding the [astro.build](http://astro.build) footer so we could link our new community website
- Building the Astro v3 to v4 upgrade guide
