### Content


Here's what caught our attention this month: 

- ⏳ Read about [how Astro's server islands deliver progressive rendering for your sites](https://developers.netlify.com/guides/how-astros-server-islands-deliver-progressive-rendering-for-your-sites/) from Rob Stanford, with one-click clone and deploy to Netlify to test drive an example project.
- 👀 You don't need to know German to understand "Astro Geht Brrrr!" means Astro goes fast! Take the fun, meme-heavy journey through [Das schnellste Framework der Welt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuOjrz8VT5k), even if it means turning on captions or auto translation.
- 🔥 Hit the 9 minute mark of [the Front-end Fire podcast](https://front-end-fire.com/episodes/53/) to hear Jack Harrington's early take on server islands.
