Astro 2.9 is out and features experiment support for [view transitions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/), as well as redirects configuration and improved script bundling.

- **[View Transitions (experimental)](#view-transitions-experimental)**
- **[Redirects](#redirects)**
- **[Hoisted script optimization](#hoisted-script-optimization)**

If you already have Astro installed, you can upgrade it to 2.9 by running the `upgrade` command in your project (using your package manager of choice):

```
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro@latest
yarn upgrade astro@latest
```

While you're at it, upgrade any `@astrojs/*` integrations and adapters you have installed, too!

## View Transitions (experimental)

Astro now supports [view transitions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/) through the new `<ViewTransitions />` component and the `transition:animate` (and associated) directives. View transitions are a great fit for content-oriented sites, and we see it as the best path to get the benefits of client-side routing (smoother transitions) without sacrificing the more simple mental model of MPAs.

Enable support for view transitions in Astro 2.9 by adding the experimental flag to your config:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    viewTransitions: true,
  },
});
```

This enables you to use the new APIs added.

### &lt;ViewTransitions /&gt;

This is a component which acts as the _router_ for transitions between pages. Add it to the `<head>` section of each individual page where transitions should occur _in the client_ as you navigate away to another page, instead of causing a full page browser refresh. To enable support throughout your entire app, add the component in some common layout or component that targets the `<head>` of every page.

**CommonHead.astro**

```astro
---
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
---

<meta charset="utf-8" />
<title>{Astro.props.title}</title>
<ViewTransitions />
```

With only this change, your app will now route completely in-client. You can then add transitions to individual elements using the `transition:animate` directive.

### Animations

Add `transition:animate` to any element to use Astro's built-in animations.

```astro
<header transition:animate="slide"></header>
```

In the above, Astro's `slide` animation will cause the `<header>` element to slide out to the left, and then slide in from the right when you navigate away from the page.

You can also customize these animations using any CSS animation properties, for example, by specifying a duration:

```astro
---
import { slide } from 'astro:transition';
---

<header transition:animate={slide({ duration: 200 })}></header>
```

### Continue learning

Check out the [client-side routing docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-routing/) to learn more.

## Redirects

This change moves the `redirects` configuration out of experimental. If you were previously using experimental redirects, remove the following experimental flag:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    redirects: true,
  }
});
```

If you have been waiting for stabilization before using redirects, now you can do so. Check out [the docs on redirects](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#redirects) to learn how to use this built-in feature.

A basic example is this, in your configuration, add a map of paths to redirect from and to:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  redirects: {
    '/old-page': '/new-page'
  }
});
```

## Hoisted script optimization

Astro's static analysis to determine which `<script>` tags to bundle together just got a little smarter!

Astro create bundles that optimize script usage between pages and place them in the head of the document so that they are downloaded as early as possible. One limitation to Astro's existing approach has been that you could not dynamically use hoisted scripts. Each page received the same, all-inclusive bundle whether or not every script was needed on that page.

Now, Astro has improved the static analysis to take into account the actual imports used.

For example, Astro would previously bundle the `<script>`s from both the `<Tab>` and `<Accordian>` component for the following library that re-exports multiple components:

**@matthewp/my-astro-lib**

```js
export { default as Tabs } from './Tabs.astro';
export { default as Accordion } from './Accordion.astro';
```

Now, when an Astro page only uses a single component, Astro will send only the necessary script to the page. A page that only imports the `<Accordian>` component will not receive any `<Tab>` component's scripts:

```astro
---
import { Accordion } from '@matthewp/my-astro-lib';
---
```

You should now see more efficient performance with Astro now supporting this common library re-export pattern.
