**⚽ Astro 5.12 knocks it into the back of the net, with an upgraded Netlify dev experience, TOML support in content loaders, and more!**

The starting lineup includes:

- [**TOML support for content loaders**](#toml-support-for-content-loaders)
- [**New Netlify dev experience**](#new-netlify-dev-experience)
- [**Experimental raw environment values**](#experimental-raw-environment-values)

To upgrade an existing project, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. Alternatively, upgrade manually by running the upgrade command for your package manager:

```sh
# Recommended:
npx @astrojs/upgrade

# Manual:
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro --latest
yarn upgrade astro --latest
```

## TOML support for content loaders

Astro 5.12 brings native support for TOML files in content collections. Astro's [`file()` and `glob()` content loaders](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/content-loader-reference/#built-in-loaders) have had you covered for Markdown, JSON, and YAML files, and now you can use TOML files as well.

There's no configuration needed to enable TOML support: just add `.toml` files to a collection using a built-in loader. For example, if you have a directory of TOML files like this:

```toml title="src/content/spacecraft/apollo.toml"
name = "Apollo"
launch_date = "1969-07-16"
crew = ["Neil Armstrong", "Buzz Aldrin", "Michael Collins"]
```

You can then create a content collection that includes the TOML files:

```ts title="src/content/config.ts" "glob({ pattern: '*.toml', base: './src/content/spacecraft' })"
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';

const spacecraft = defineCollection({
	loader: glob({ pattern: '*.toml', base: './src/content/spacecraft' }),
	schema: z.object({
		name: z.string(),
		launch_date: z.coerce().date(),
		crew: z.array(z.string()),
	}),
});
export const collections = { spacecraft };
```

You can then access the TOML content in your Astro components:

```astro title="src/pages/spacecraft.astro"
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

const spacecraft = await getCollection('spacecraft');
---

<ul>
	{
		spacecraft.map((item) => (
			<li>
				<h2>{item.name}</h2>
				<p>Launch Date: {item.launch_date.toLocaleDateString()}</p>
				<p>Crew: {item.crew.join(', ')}</p>
			</li>
		))
	}
</ul>
```

## New Netlify dev experience

The [Netlify adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/) is now powered by Netlify's very own [Vite plugin](https://docs.netlify.com/build/frameworks/framework-setup-guides/vite/#vite-plugin) during development, bringing Netlify's entire platform and primitives to your local dev environment!

### The power of Netlify on localhost

Until now, using Netlify primitives with Astro during local development required running your project through the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/api-and-cli-guides/cli-guides/get-started-with-cli/). The new adapter embeds these capabilities directly into Astro's dev server instead.

After upgrading to the latest version of the adapter, running `astro dev` will provide:

- A local [Netlify Image CDN](https://docs.netlify.com/build/image-cdn/overview/#local-development) server. This is used for [images](#netlify-image-cdn-support) by default
- A local [Netlify Blobs](https://docs.netlify.com/build/data-and-storage/netlify-blobs/) server. This is used for [sessions](#sessions) by default
- [Redirects, rewrites](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) and [headers](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/#app) from your Netlify config
- The [Netlify Edge Context](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/#accessing-edge-context-from-your-site) in on-demand pages
- [Environment variables](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/) populated from your linked Netlify site

### Configuring dev features

Along with these features comes a way to configure them. The Netlify adapter now accepts a `devFeatures` option in its configuration to customize which features are enabled during development. Currently, the features you can configure are:

- `images`: Enables the local Netlify Image CDN for Astro images during dev. Defaults to `true`.
- `environmentVariables`: Automatically populates your development server with environment variables from your linked Netlify site. Defaults to `false`.

You pass this as an option to the Netlify adapter in your Astro configuration file:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={6-9}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify'

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: netlify({
    devFeatures: {
      environmentVariables: true,
      images: false,
    },
  })
})
```

Now you can enjoy the rich Netlify flavor in your own home!

## Experimental raw environment values

A new experimental configuration option allows you to opt out of Astro's automatic type coercion for environment variable values in `import.meta.env`. By default, Astro converts string values like `"true"`, `"false"`, `"1"`, and `"0"` to their respective types, but this can be unexpected since environment variables are generally expected to be strings.

This aligns Astro's behavior with [Vite's handling of environment variables](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables), and is likely to become the default in a future major release.

To enable this feature, add the `rawEnvValues` flag to your Astro configuration:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={3}
export default defineConfig({
	experimental: {
		rawEnvValues: true,
	},
});
```

This experimental option only affects the `import.meta.env` object and doesn't impact the `astro:env` module that powers Astro's [type-safe environment variables](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables).
