We are thrilled to announce [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=astro&utm_campaign=astro-spotlight) 
as Astro’s new **Official Monitoring Partner**, which includes a  new $5,000 monthly donation towards 
the ongoing open source maintenance and development of Astro.

**Astro is the web framework for building content-driven websites including blogs, marketing, and 
e-commerce.** When you go to deploy an Astro website, it’s a good idea to setup live monitoring for 
insights into performance issues and JavaScript errors that your users might encounter. That’s where Sentry comes in.

The Astro core team has relied on Sentry in the past to help find and fix difficult bugs in production. 
[This console warning](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8981), for example, would only appear 
in very specific circumstances on mobile Safari once a user had scrolled for longer than 30 seconds. 
Apparently, this happens more often than you would think! Thanks to a Sentry user the warning was 
identified, reported, and fixed in Astro for the benefit of everyone.

David Cramer, Founder and CTO of Sentry, had this to say:

		Astro is one of the most promising technologies we've seen in the last few years, and we're excited to be working more closely with the Astro community. With the launch of @sentry/astro integration is now plug n' play, and we're thrilled to count Astro as a launch partner for Spotlight.

## Introducing Spotlight: A Better Local Debugging Experience, Designed for Astro

Astro 4.0 introduced the Dev Toolbar — a new way to enhance and extend your local development experience in the browser. As part of this new partnership, we are excited to feature Spotlight as a launch-day app from Sentry.

Spotlight brings a rich debug overlay into your Astro development environment. Spotlight can show you errors, traces, and rich debugging information right in your browser during local development. 

To use Spotlight, run `astro add` in the terminal to add it to your project. Then, start up your Astro development environment and click the new “Spotlight” logo in your Dev Toolbar to open the new Spotlight app.

## Astro ❤️ Sentry

Astro is honored and excited to have [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=astro&utm_campaign=astro-spotlight) as our new official monitoring partner. We are grateful for the support of David Cramer and the entire Sentry team for their help and evangelism of open source software. It’s because of support from companies like Sentry that we are able to receive ongoing maintenance and keep developing Astro in an open, financially-sustainable way.
