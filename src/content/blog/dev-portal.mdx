<BlogSummary>
Today, we're launching [the Astro Developer Portal](https://portal.astro.build), a platform where theme authors and creators can create, own and update their themes built for Astro.
</BlogSummary>

At Astro, we're dedicated to crafting solutions that not only benefit our users but also address our internal challenges. One such solution is the new Developer Portal, which will serve as the future home for all Astro developers. Our aim with the Developer Portal is to provide a centralised platform where theme creators, and eventually integration creators, can have full control over their creations. Another goal was to test drive Astro Studio, its capabilities, and identify bugs early.

Today, we're taking the new Astro Developer Portal in use. A platform, where theme authors and creators, can fully create, own and update their themes built for Astro.

Check it out at [portal.astro.build](https://portal.astro.build).

## Problems in our current setup

The old method of adding themes to the Astro catalog was a very time-consuming and inefficient process. Theme creators were required to fill out a form, which triggered a manual process for the Astro core team. Images and content had to be extracted from Discord messages, formatted, and integrated into our theme content collection catalog. Updating themes was equally cumbersome, requiring manual repository forks and PR submissions by theme authors.

You probably get that it's not the most ideal way of handling that, right?

## Solution

Out of identifying those problems and challenges, we came up with a new idea. A digital portal where theme creators can upload, update, and manage their themes. A core member only has to step in once, to approve a new theme, but that is now a simple click of a button. Using Astro Studio and Astro DB, we are able to handle the entire process using a web application, instead of requiring manual steps, such as creating PRs and managing content.

## Dogfooding Astro Studio

As we delved deeper into building the Developer Portal, we started dogfooding Astro Studio. What could be more powerful then using the tool you're building to build the tool you're building? It's a great way to identify bugs and issues early on, and to test the limits of the tool.

Initially, we encountered two significant challenges using Astro Studio: authentication and image storage. To address authentication, we integrated Supabase, leveraging its OAuth with GitHub for streamlined access. Yet, we realised the need for a unified solution that would leverage the power of Astro Studio and transitioned to [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/).

For image storage, we set up a very simple cloud storage bucket with Google Cloud that will handle all storage and image processing without any manual intervention. Again, showcasing how powerful an Astro powered application and database can be.

## What's next

Looking ahead, there's still much to be done to enhance the Developer Portal experience. Our focus remains on refining the platform and incorporating user feedback. While we have exciting ideas in the pipeline, our primary goal is to continue dogfooding Astro Studio to deliver the best possible experience for Astro developers using Astro Studio.

Join us on this journey as we strive to make the theme creation and management process smoother and more enjoyable for all.

See you in space, Astronauts!
