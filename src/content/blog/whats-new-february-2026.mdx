I’m beyond grateful to share that we won SOTD at CSS Design Awards and CSS Winner ! Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to give feedback on the website — your support truly made a difference. And the journey continues… we’re also nominated on Awwwards !

You can check out the project here: [https://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/siempreric/48860/](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/siempreric/48860/ "https://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/siempreric/48860/")

an open-source design system that runs inside Claude Code.

You describe your brand in conversation — your audience, the feel, the constraints. Angora reads your tokens, your existing components, your anti-patterns, and builds things that belong in your system. The output is static HTML and CSS via Astro. What you see in the browser is what ships.

Python REPL IDE

Please check out this fun thing I made. I call it the Python Repl IDE, an online web app for coding.

Extra steps: AI hype -> CS primatives
https://extra-steps.dev/

> 	I built a reference site that maps AI marketing buzzwords to the CS primitives underneath them. Every entry follows the same format: "X is just Y with extra steps."
MCP? JSON-RPC over stdio. Agents? A while loop with an LLM call. RAG? A search index + string concatenation. Prompt engineering? natural language + markdown
>
>The site has an origins section for buzzwords that already graduated — Docker (cgroups + namespaces), Kubernetes (reconciliation loops watching YAML), Serverless (someone else's process on someone else's computer). And of course, BrandonM's 2007 comment on the Dropbox YC demo.
>
>Each entry has expandable pseudocode on the index page, detailed breakdowns with citations on the detail pages.
>
> The motivation: I keep having conversations at work where a product executive suggests that we "orchestrate APIs using MCP" or asks about implementing "agentic memory" in our web apps and the fastest path to a productive conversation is showing them the code underneath the buzzword. I wanted a community-based reference site like caniuse or mdn that I loved when learning to code. I couldn't find one, so I built one.
