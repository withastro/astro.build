Astro 2.2 is out! Included in this release are:

- **[CDN support for assets](#cdn-support)**: You can now deploy your assets to a CDN external to your site, and Astro will load them from there.
- **[image() schema helper API change](#image-schema-api-change)**: (experimental) The image() helper has been moved to be inline with the schema definition.

Additionally, Astro 2.2 includes **8 patch changes** and was released alongside **8 integrations** with patch releases.

Run `npm i astro@latest` to upgrade to the latest version.

## CDN support

In 2.2 you can now configure Astro to point to a CDN in order to load your assets. In your Astro config:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"

export default defineConfig({
	build: {
		assetsPrefix: "https://cdn.example.com",
	},
})
```

After you've run the build (`astro build`) your HTML (both in SSG and SSR modes) will include links that include the prefix for any assets; scripts and stylesheets.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/_astro/global.css" />
```

The assets are still built to your `dist/` folder, like always. You will need to configure your deployment scripts to deploy `dist/_astro/` to your CDN.

## image() schema API change

In 2.2 the `image()` schema helper in the experimental assets API has been moved to a callback where the schema is defined.

```js
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content"

const blog = defineCollection({
	schema: ({ image }) =>
		z.object({
			image: image().refine((img) => img.width >= 200, {
				message: "image too small",
			}),
		}),
})
```

Previously `image()` was imported directly from `'astro:content'`. This created bugs where Astro was not able to correctly resolve relative image assets defined in the frontmatter.

Providing the helper as a callback aligns with how Zod suggests doing contextual references. This new callback-based schema assignment is currently only available behind the assets flag. If you are not using the image() helper you can continue to assign the schemas directly to the `schema` property on the collection.
