_“There’s a simple secret to building a faster website — just ship less.”_ That was how we [introduced Astro](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro/) to the world almost one year ago.

A lot has happened since then: 10,000+ GitHub stars. 150,000+ npm downloads. 25,000 code commits made by over 240 individual contributors. Thousands of websites built with Astro that are already running in production at Google, Trivago, Netlify and more.

But we’re just getting started.

**Join us on Monday April 4 for the official launch of the** **Astro v1.0.0 Beta Release!**
Our maintainers have been hard at work preparing this release and we can’t wait to show off what we’ve built. After a year of heads-down development, Astro is now preparing for takeoff. T-Minus: 7 days.

**But why stop at just one announcement?** We’ll be sharing even more exciting news _every day of the week_. That’s FIVE days of never-before-seen demos, groundbreaking new features, livestreams, Q&As with our community and more.

Whether you are already an Astro user or just curious to learn more, this is going to be an exciting week!
