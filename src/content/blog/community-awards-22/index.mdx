I’m thrilled to announce the winners of Astro Contributor Awards for 2022!

**What are the Astro Contributor Awards?** Every so often, we distribute 100% of our monthly **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/astrodotbuild)** sponsorship funds to standout members of our community. These awards are peer-nominated within our Discord, and go to recognize the people who go above and beyond to improve Astro in any meaningful way. You can see our past winners [here](/blog/contributor-awards-4/) and [here](/blog/community-day/).
