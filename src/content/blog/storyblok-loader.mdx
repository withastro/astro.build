import Blockquote from "/src/components/Blockquote.astro"

We are thrilled to announce that [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) is a launch partner for the Astro Content Layer API, our new approach to bring remote and CMS data into [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/). Storyblok is a pioneer in headless CMS, featuring a built-in visual editor. It enables collaboration with marketers without hindering development teams from adopting emerging front-end technologies.

With the content layer you can now combine content from CMSes like Storyblok, alongside your local git-backed Markdown and MDX. With the Storyblok loader, you can sync your remote data in dev and get automatic refreshes as it changes.

## Using the Storyblok loader

To use the new loader (in alpha), first install the `@storyblok/astro` package:

```shell
npm install @storyblok/astro@alpha
```

Then import and use the loader inside of your `src/content/config.ts` configuration file:

```ts
import { storyblokLoader } from "@storyblok/astro";
import { defineCollection } from "astro:content";

const storyblokCollection = defineCollection({
  loader: storyblokLoader({
    accessToken: import.meta.env.STORYBLOK_TOKEN,
    version: "published",
  }),
})

export const collections = {
  storyblok: storyblokCollection,
}
```

And that's it, from here you can query and use collections the same way you would for local collections. Storyblok comes with a `StoryblokComponent` that renders blocks for you. Here's an example of how you might use it in a spread route.

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
import StoryblokComponent from "@storyblok/astro/StoryblokComponent.astro";
import BaseLayout from "~/layouts/BaseLayout.astro";
import { type ISbStoryData } from "@storyblok/astro";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const stories = await getCollection("storyblok");

  return stories.map(({ data }: { data: ISbStoryData }) => {
    return {
      params: { slug: data.full_slug },
      props: { story: data },
    };
  });
}

interface Props {
  story: ISbStoryData;
}

const { story } = Astro.props;
---

<BaseLayout>
  <StoryblokComponent blok={story.content} />
</BaseLayout>
```
