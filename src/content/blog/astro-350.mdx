## i18n Routing (experimental)

It's now easier than ever to build multilingual apps with Astro.

Astro's experimental i18n routing API allows you to add your multilingual content with support for configuring a default language, computing relative page URLs, and accepting preferred languages provided by your visitor's browser. You can also specify fallback languages on a per-language basis so that your visitors can always be directed to existing content on your site.

Enable the experimental routing option by adding an `i18n` object to your Astro configuration with a default location and a list of all languages to support:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import {defineConfig} from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    i18n: {
      defaultLocale: "en",
      locales: ["en", "es", "pt-br"]
    }
  }
})
```

Organize your content folders by locale depending on your `i18n.routingStrategy`, and Astro will handle generating your routes and showing your preferred URLs to your visitors.
```
├── src
│   ├── pages
│   │   ├── about.astro
│   │   ├── index.astro
│   │   ├── es
│   │   │   ├── about.astro
│   │   │   ├── index.astro
│   │   ├── pt-br
│   │   │   ├── about.astro
│   │   │   ├── index.astro
```

Compute relative URLs for your links with `getLocaleRelativeURL` from the new `astro:i18n` module:

```astro
---
import {getLocaleRelativeUrl} from "astro:i18n";
const aboutUrl = getLocaleRelativeUrl("pt-br", "about");
---
<p>Learn more <a href={aboutURL}>About</a> this site!</p>
```

Enabling i18n routing also provides two new properties for browser language detection: `Astro.preferredLocale` and `Astro.preferredLocaleList`. These combine the browser's `Accept-Language` header, and your site's list of supported languages and can be used to automatically respect your visitor's preferred languages.

## Prefetch

[Prefetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prefetch) is a browser feature to fetch pages in advance for your visitors so that they are partially-loaded even before navigation. For multi-page apps, prefetch is an important part of keeping your site speedy.

Prefetch in Astro had previously been available via an official integration (`@astrojs/prefetch`). Today we are bringing prefetch into core as an opt-in feature, and expanding what it can do.

You can enable prefetching by setting `prefetch:true` in your Astro config:

```js 
// astro.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  prefetch: true
})
```

In addition to now being a core feature, the new prefetch also comes with more flexibility:

- Configure whether prefetching occurs on `tap` (a touch that's not a full click), `hover`, or upon entering the `viewport`.
- Define which strategy is used on a per-link basis using the `data-astro-prefetch` attribute.
- Set prefetching on *all links* by default (the existing behavior when using `<ViewTransitions />`).
- Ignore hover and scroll events that occur quickly, to prevent overfetching content your visitor is not likely to click.

Prefetch is enabled by default when using [View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) and the new implementation now makes it possible to opt out of prefetch on a per-link basis:

```js
<a href="/logout" data-astro-prefetch="false">Logout</a>
```

Visit the [Prefetch guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/prefetch/) for more information.

## Form support in View Transitions

The `<ViewTransitions />` router can now handle form submissions, allowing the same animated transitions and stateful UI retention on form posts that are already available on `<a>` links. With this addition, your Astro project can have animations in all of these scenarios:

- Clicking links between pages.
- Making stateful changes in forms (e.g. updating site preferences).
- Manually triggering navigation via the `navigate()` API.

This feature is currently opt-in, but will be enabled by default starting in Astro 4.0. To enable, add the `handleForms` prop to the `<ViewTransitions />` component on your page:

```astro
---
// src/layouts/MainLayout.astro
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
---

<html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <ViewTransitions handleForms />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Just as with links, if you don't want the routing handling a form submission, you can opt out on a per-form basis with the `data-astro-reload` property:

```astro
---
// src/components/Contact.astro
---
<form class="contact-form" action="/request" method="post" data-astro-reload>
  <!-- ...-->
</form>
```

Form support works on post `method="get"` and `method="post"` forms.

## Image optimization improvements

Astro assets has continued to undergo improvements and in 3.5 we now have:

- Original images are deleted from the final build that are not used outside of the optimization pipeline. For users with a large number of these images (e.g. thumbnails), this should reduce storage consumption and deployment times.
- A new property, `propertiesToHash`, has been added to allow specifying which properties of `getImage()` / `<Image />` / `<Picture />` should be used for hashing the result files when doing local transformations. For most services, this will include properties such as `src`, `width`, or `quality` that directly change the content of the generated image.
- The `<Picture />` component will now use `jpg` and `jpeg` respectively as fallback formats when the original image is in those formats. 

## Integration Hooks to add Middleware

It's now possible in Astro for an integration to add middleware on behalf of the user. Previously when a third party wanted to provide middleware, the user would need to create a `src/middleware.ts` file themselves. Now, adding third-party middleware is as easy as adding a new integration.

For integration authors, there is a new `addMiddleware` function in the `astro:config:setup` hook. This function allows you to specify a middleware module and the order in which it should be applied:

```js
// my-package/middleware.js
import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware';

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
  const response = await next();

  if(response.headers.get('content-type') === 'text/html') {
    let html = await response.text();
    html = minify(html);
    return new Response(html, {
      status: response.status,
      headers: response.headers
    });
  }

  return response;
});
```

You can now add your integration's middleware and specify that it runs either before or after the application's own defined middleware (defined in `src/middleware.{js,ts}`)

```js
// my-package/integration.js
export function myIntegration() {
  return {
    name: 'my-integration',
    hooks: {
      'astro:config:setup': ({ addMiddleware }) => {
        addMiddleware({
          entrypoint: 'my-package/middleware',
          order: 'pre'
        });
      }
    }
  };
}
```

## Multiple code themes (experimental)

Astro recently upgraded to use the [shikiji](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji) library for syntax highlighting, and we've now added the ability to support multiple themes via a new  `markdown.shikiConfig.experimentalThemes` option.

This enables you to more easily define a light and dark mode theme for syntax highlighted code blocks. You might use it like this:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      experimentalThemes: {
        light: 'github-light',
        dark: 'github-dark'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Qwik Integration

From our community, there is now an Astro integration for using [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) with Astro! You can install the Qwik integration by running:

```shell
npx astro add @qwikdev/astro
```

Or you can install the integration yourself, and update your config:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import qwikdev from '@qwikdev/astro';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [qwikdev()],
});
```

Check out the [blog post](https://www.builder.io/blog/astro-qwik) to learn more about the new integration and if you run into any issues visit the [integration repository](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro/issues).
