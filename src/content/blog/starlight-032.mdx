import Note from '~/components/Note.astro';

**Starlight 0.32 is here! Let‚Äôs unpack what‚Äôs new as we work our way towards a v1 release.**

üßò We‚Äôve been stretching to make Starlight extra extendable. Here‚Äôs our latest flow for more flexibility:

- [**Route data middleware**](#a-new-route-data-paradigm)
- [**New i18n APIs for plugins**](#new-i18n-apis-for-plugins)
- [**Updated plugin hooks**](#updated-plugin-hooks)
- [**Multisite search support**](#multisite-search-support)

To upgrade an existing Starlight site, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. This will update Starlight, Astro, and any other integrations you are using:

```sh
npx @astrojs/upgrade
```

<Note title="Using plugins?">
	Community Starlight plugins may also need to be manually updated to work with
	Starlight 0.32. If you encounter any issues, please reach out to the plugin
	author to see if it is a known issue or if an updated version is being worked
	on.
</Note>

## A new route data paradigm

Starlight‚Äôs [component override](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) system allows users to customize a site‚Äôs appearance with their own components. This is great for extending Starlight‚Äôs UI, but over time, we saw a pattern develop where people also used overrides to modify component data, while still reusing Starlight‚Äôs built-in components.

To make this use case easier, v0.32 introduces **a new route middleware system** that provides full access to Starlight‚Äôs data model without needing to override any components. This is particularly helpful for plugins as it avoids common conflicts where several plugins tried to override the same component.

Similar to Astro‚Äôs middleware system, route middleware is called for every Starlight page render and gives you the opportunity to modify any data before it gets rendered. This is a powerful way to implement custom logic not currently possible with configuration alone.

In the following example, we try to make our docs more exciting by adding exclamation marks to the end of every page‚Äôs title!!!

```js
import { defineRouteMiddleware } from '@astrojs/starlight/route-data';

export const onRequest = defineRouteMiddleware((context) => {
	// Get the content collection entry for this page.
	const { entry } = context.locals.starlightRoute;
	// Update the title to add exclamation marks.
	entry.data.title = entry.data.title + '!!!';
});
```

See the [‚ÄúRoute Data‚Äù](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data) guide for full details about how to write route middleware.

### Breaking changes

To better support route middleware, we have updated how Starlight‚Äôs default components receive route data.

Previously, all of Starlight‚Äôs templating components, including user or plugin overrides, had access to a data object for the current route via `Astro.props`. This data is now available as `Astro.locals.starlightRoute` instead.

See the [Starlight changelog](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/CHANGELOG.md) for full details of how to migrate to this new approach.

## New i18n APIs for plugins

This release gives plugins full access to Starlight‚Äôs powerful built-in [internationalization system](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/).

Plugins can now call [`useTranslations()`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#usetranslations) in the `config:setup` hook to access any of Starlight‚Äôs UI strings. This opens up possibilities for localized logging, using translations in Markdown plugins, and more.

This example plugin logs Starlight‚Äôs default ‚ÄúBuilt with Starlight‚Äù text string and uses the translation matching the user‚Äôs locale if it is available:

```js "useTranslations" "useTranslations(userLocale)"
export default {
	name: 'localizedPlugin',
	hooks: {
		'config:setup'({ useTranslations, logger }) {
			// Detect the current user‚Äôs preferred locale.
			const userLocale = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().locale;
			// Get a `t()` function for the locale.
			const t = useTranslations(userLocale);
			// Log the localized string.
			logger.info(t('builtWithStarlight.label'));
		},
	},
};
```

## Updated plugin hooks

As part of the rework to support translation use in plugins, we have split the old `setup` hook into two: [`i18n:setup`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#i18nsetup) and [`config:setup`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#configsetup). Use of the `setup` hook is deprecated and plugins should migrate to using `config:setup` instead:

```js del={4} ins={5}
  export default {
    name: 'starlight-plugin',
    hooks: {
      'setup'({ config }) {
      'config:setup'({ config }) {
        // Your plugin configuration setup code
      },
    },
  };
```

Plugins using the `injectTranslations()` utility need to move this to the dedicated `i18n:setup` hook:

```js del={4} ins={5}
  export default {
    name: 'plugin-with-translations',
    hooks: {
      'config:setup'({ injectTranslations }) {
      'i18n:setup'({ injectTranslations }) {
        injectTranslations({
          en: { 'myPlugin.doThing': 'Do the thing' },
          fr: { 'myPlugin.doThing': 'Faire le truc' },
        });
      },
    },
  };
```

## Multisite search support

Starlight provides site search out of the box using [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/). This release exposes Pagefind‚Äôs multisite search configuration, so you can support searching across multiple sites.

For example, if you have a main site at `example.com` indexed with Pagefind and your Starlight site deployed to the `docs.example.com` subdomain, you can display search results from your main site in your docs with the `mergeIndex` configuration option:

```js {10-12}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';

export default defineConfig({
	site: 'https://docs.example.com/',
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: 'Docs with multisite search',
			pagefind: {
				mergeIndex: [{ bundlePath: 'https://example.com/pagefind' }],
			},
		}),
	],
});
```

See Pagefind‚Äôs guide to [‚ÄúSearching multiple sites‚Äù](https://pagefind.app/docs/multisite/) for full details of the available configuration options.

## Bug fixes and more

As always, we‚Äôve also been working to fix issues since the v0.31 release. See the [Starlight changelog](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/CHANGELOG.md) for all the details including detailed migration guidance.
