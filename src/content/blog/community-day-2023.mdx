Astro continues to evolve how it works with and for its community. 

With generous Open Collective funding support, we regularly recognize and reward people in our community who made a difference that month: submitting code and bug fixes, being welcoming and helpful in support threads, translating the docs, and other contributions that enrich everyone's Astro experience.

Previously a quarterly event, Astro kicked it into high gear over the last few months and committed to issuing awards on a monthly basis. We also changed the nomination structure from peer-nominated awards to core-maintainer nominated awards. 

This might sound less democratic, but our motivations were to **ensure that our core maintainers were actively on the lookout for the next crop of up-and-comers**. We now hold monthly maintainer meetings entirely dedicated to thinking about and shouting out who is most active in our community. As a core team, we dedicate time to our open-source community's health, growth, and sustainability.

A community award is nice, but until now, this recognition has mostly stayed within our community. We wanted a better, more public, and more permanent place for community recognition. Somewhere you could show off to friends and family, maybe to explain where all those nights and weekends went!

We are thrilled to announce the launch of our first public community space: https://community.astro.build built by our first Community Engineer, Elian van Cutsem.

The first challenge was to design a friendly and welcoming homepage, which gives the visitor all the information about our Community Awards at a glance. For that, the DX team worked closely with our designer Mark to set up a homepage and design language. Once we were happy with the design, we started building an Astro website and translating our design into components, with a focus on accessibility and SEO.

Right now, the website serves a single purpose: to showcase the Astro Community Award winners. But, our plan is to incrementally expand the website with more community initiatives & projects in the future.

Today, you can visit and celebrate the people who help make Astro the project you love to use. Stay tuned for more exciting community initiatives that will find a home there as we grow and extend the site!

## Maintainer Projects

Each week in our community calls, and in our Discord `#showcase` channel, we highlight and celebrate all the things our community builds with Astro. Not everyone can make the weekly call, so we started posting weekly recaps in our `#announcements` channel. We also now post monthly blog posts so you'll never miss the best new sites, tools and articles made by and for our community.

We wanted to take this opportunity to recognize a very special kind of community contribution that you might not normally see: the personal experiments and side projects that our own maintainers build to make *working on* and *contributing to* Astro as great an experience as we hope building with Astro is for you.

Maintaining an open source project means spending a lot of time in our code editors, in PRs and on GitHub, looking things up in docs, keeping track of work-in-progress, and collaborating with others.

We'd like to showcase some of these tools we've built for our *own* use as we, and our community contributors, build Astro for you. Some of these make routine tasks easier, and some just make them more fun... because that's part of the point, too!
