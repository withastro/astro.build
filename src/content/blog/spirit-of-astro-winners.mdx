**We’re excited to announce the winning designs from the Spirit of Astro Design Contest!**

Held over the last few months to celebrate the new look [Astro Mart][shop], we’ve had an amazing time seeing the submissions come in.
Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their creativity and imagination with us.
The Astro community is what powers the project, and it was a privilege to get to see the love and enthusiasm put into everyone’s designs.

So let’s meet the winners!

## Stellar swag

[Christina Martinez](https://christinacodes.dev/) joined the dots to create a unique take on the Astro logo: as a constellation chart!
Christina’s design highlights some of the star Astro features: content collections, zero JS by default, and island architecture.

[Louis Escher](https://lou.gg/) delivered a pixel perfect design with versions of the Astro logo and Houston in an old school 8-bit graphics style.
This mug is sure to keep your components hydrated!

## Launch your next voyage

[Hazim Sami](https://bsky.app/profile/hazims.bsky.social) blew us away with **multiple** stunning designs, so we decided to add two to our store.
Take your pick between a retro look with typography that throws back to 1960s poster design or a minimal, isometric “launch” button that will run `create astro` at warp speed.
