<BlogSummary>
  Astro 4.15 is out now! This release stabilize Astro Actions - our solution for fully type-safe backend functions. Also included: support for LibSQL remotes in Astro DB, a new timeout option for `client:idle`, and more.
</BlogSummary>

This release includes the following highlights:

- [**Stable: Astro Actions**](#stable-astro-actions)
- [**Experimental: Reworked TypeScript handling**](#experimental-reworked-typescript-handling)
- [**Use rewrites for i18n fallbacks**](#rewrites-in-i18n-fallbacks)
- [**LibSQL remotes in @astrojs/db**](#libsql-remotes-in-astro-db)
- [**Timeout option in client:idle**](#timeout-option-in-clientidle)
- [**Swap helpers available for ViewTransitions customizations**](#swap-helpers-for-viewtransitions)

To upgrade an existing project, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. Alternatively, upgrade manually by running the upgrade command for your package manager:

```sh
# Recommended:
npx @astrojs/upgrade

# Manual:
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro --latest
yarn upgrade astro --latest
```

## Stable: Astro Actions

TODO: Ben, write this section!

## Experimental: Reworked TypeScript handling

Astro currently generates a `src/env.d.ts` file in your project to provide various types to your project, such as `import.meta.env` or your content collections' types. This file is generated by Astro and it's always been little bit unclear if it's intended to be edited by the user or not. In Astro 4.15, we are experimenting with a new approach to hooking up those types so that this file would no longer be needed in the future.

This experimental method works by generating a `tsconfig.json` in the `.astro` directory that includes the necessary types and is destined to be extended from by your project's `tsconfig.json`. In addition of giving you control over your project's files, this approach also gives us more flexibility with how we handle Astro's TypeScript support in the future.

Thanks to [florian-lefebvre](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre) who has been championing recent TypeScript improvements such as this one in Astro.

To enable this feature, set the following option in your Astro config:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"

export default defineConfig({
	experimental: {
		tsconfig: true
	}
})
```

We hope for this feature to be enabled by default in future versions of Astro. If you have any feedback on this feature, let us know!

## Rewrites in i18n fallbacks

A new option was added to [internationalization (i18n) routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/internationalization/) which allows more control over how fallbacks are handled. You can now specify whether a fallback results in a rewrite (a `200` response from the server) or a redirect, the current default.

The fallback system in i18n allows you to define which content is used for a locale when that content is not available in the user's locale. For example your config might look like:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"
export default defineConfig({
  i18n: {
    defaultLocale: "en",
    locales: ["es", "en", "fr"],
    fallback: {
      fr: "es"
    },
    routing: {
      fallbackType: "rewrite"
    }
  }
})
```

For more information on this new feature, see [our revamped documentation on handling fallbacks in i18n](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/internationalization/#fallback).

## LibSQL remotes in Astro DB

You can now specify a [LibSQL](https://turso.tech/libsql) server instance as the remote for `@astrojs/db`. This allows you to self-host your own LibSQL server as an alternative to using Astro DB with Astro Studio. This option works with any supported LibSQL protocol.

To use this feature, set the following environment variables:

- `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL`: the connection URL to your LibSQL server.
- `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN`: the auth token to your LibSQL server.

Enabling this feature allows you to both connect to the LibSQL server in your production environment, it also allows you to use the Astro DB deployment and push (migration) commands with the LibSQL instance. Thanks to [Fryuni](https://github.com/Fryuni) for this amazing contribution!

For more information on using LibSQL servers in Astro DB, [visit our AstroDB guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/#libsql).

## Timeout option in `client:idle`

The `client:idle` directive is used to load an [Astro Island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) when the user's CPU is idle (which no other JavaScript is executing). Under the hood this feature relies on the [requestIdleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) feature of browsers.

In Astro 4.15, you can now specify a `timeout` property that will trigger the island to load if it has not already done so in that time. This is useful to add priority to a component that might be competing with other idle components.

```astro
{/* Many many components */}
{Array.from({ length: 3000 }).map((_, i) => (<Counter id={`client-idle-${i}`} count={i} client:idle>
	<h1>Hello, client:idle! ${i}</h1>
</Counter>))}

{/* Component loads after a maximum wait of 500ms */}
<Counter id="client-idle-timeout" {...someProps} client:idle={{ timeout: 500 }}>
	<h1>Hello, client:idle={'{{timeout: 500}}'}!</h1>
</Counter>
```

## Swap helpers for ViewTransitions

Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` router works by turning your MPA (multi-page app) into a SPA (single-page app), while attempting to preserve the DX of a MPA. It does this by fetching pages on navigation and swapping the content. In some cases you might want more control over how the swap works, which can be done by overriding the swap in the [`astro:before-swap`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#astrobefore-swap) event.

In Astro 4.15, the built-in swap functions are now exported from `astro:transitions/client`. These helpers allow you to use parts of what Astro does by default, with your own custom logic in between.

```astro
<script>
import { swapFunctions } from 'astro:transitions/client';

document.addEventListener('astro:before-swap', (e) => {
  e.swap = () => swapMainOnly(e.newDocument);
});

function swapMainOnly(doc: Document) {
  swapFunctions.deselectScripts(doc);
  swapFunctions.swapRootAttributes(doc);
  swapFunctions.swapHeadElements(doc);
  const restoreFocusFunction = swapFunctions.saveFocus();
  const newMain = doc.querySelector('main');
  const oldMain = document.querySelector('main');
  if (newMain && oldMain) {
    swapFunctions.swapBodyElement(newMain, oldMain);
  } else {
    swapFunctions.swapBodyElement(doc.body, document.body);
  }
  restoreFocusFunction();
}
<script>
```
