		fact: `As a support squad member, I got annoyed with having to switch over to a browser to search the docs, so I wrote a bot with a /docs command which allowed me to browse the docs from within discord. After people noticed my work on the bot, some maintainers requested a /ptal (Please Take A Look) command to have an easier overview of the status of a pull request. Fun fact: a /ptal command had been discussed a year earlier, before I even joined the server, but it never got far. I only found out about this a while after I independently developed the command.`,

On top of accurate syntax highlighting powered by the same engine as VS Code, Expressive Code allows you to annotate code blocks using text markers, diff highlighting, code editor & terminal window frames, and more.",
		fact: "After I initially built these features into Astro Docs, users kept asking us how they could use our code snippets in their own projects. This led me to create Expressive Code as a standalone project, which actually became my first published set of NPM packages! I‚Äôm really happy that it‚Äôs already being used by Astro Docs, Starlight, and many individual websites.",

Building such a Service is not trivial, the most complex thing to get right is Authorization. How to make sure only Astro users can use it for free and having a fair-use policy in place.",

The major benefit of having common workflows in a single location is that maintenance happens in one spot and is automatically rolled out to all of our repositories. Centralized workflows also make it much easier to set up automated workflows for brand new repositories.",
		fact: "When we first started building Astro, we had one central astro monorepo for all of our code and documentation. This made it easy to share tooling and configuration but it became increasingly difficult to collaborate on many different focus areas as the project grew. While copying and pasting workflow files works for a small handful of repositories, the number of repositories began to grow in the summer of 2023. The automation repository is used by all of our repositories to share merge notifications in our Discord (congratsbot), format our source code with Prettier (format), and automate issue labelling (issue-opened and issue-labeled)",

		fact: "Astro Badges started as a weekend project after I noticed the badg.es domain was available. It‚Äôs grown a lot since then, including a full redesign, collaborating with Astro‚Äôs designer, @doodlemarks. Probably the most challenging thing about maintaining it is coming up with fun achievement names, although @sarah11918 is always game to workshop them! My favourite recent addition is probably the SSRsly achievement for people working on Astro‚Äôs serverless adapters.
