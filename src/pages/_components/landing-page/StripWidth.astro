// This is a bit of a hack.
// Astro Icon always adds `width` and `height` attributes to icons but that can mess with
// responsive layouts. This component removes the first `width` attribute it finds in its
// child content.

let html = await Astro.slots.render('default');
html = html.replace(/width="[^"]+"/, '');

<Fragment set:html={html} />
