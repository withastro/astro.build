**Astro v1.0.0 has a new release date!** We're pushing back our v1.0.0 release to late July so that we can fix some final bugs and improve the developer experience before releasing Astro to the world.

Since we announced the [Astro v1.0 Beta](https://astro.build/blog/astro-1-beta-release/) back in April, we have collected a ton of feedback from early adopters. We've used that feedback to fix bugs, make HMR upgrades, and vastly improve the overall developer experience from where it was just two months ago. Open issues have dropped from 130 to just 56 in the last few weeks alone.

<!-- Comment for Nate: Do we have a graph that we could show of open issues? maybe https://9-volt.github.io/bug-life/ ? -->

In order to deliver on the best-in-class developer experience that we promised, we've decided to delay Astro's release by another month. We'll be using this period to:

- Invest in even more out-of-the-box performance optimizations
- Improve error handling in our compiler
- Deliver dev server improvements like better HMR and more accurate stacktraces
- Resolve incoming bug reports as quickly as possible

In the meantime, please continue to use the [Astro v1.0 Beta Release](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), which benefits from all of these improvements with new releases coming every week.

Thank you for your patience as we continue the best website build tool on the planet. If you want to get involved or share your own feedback with the team, please [visit our GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro) repository and [join us on Discord](https://astro.build/chat).
