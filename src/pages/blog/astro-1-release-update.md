We're pushing back the release date of Astro v1.0.0. **Astro v1.0.0 will be available in late July 2022**.

Since our the launch of Astro's v1.0.0 Beta back in April 2022, we have been collecting incredible real-world feedback from our early adopters. While the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, it also uncovered a handful of use cases where Astro has room for improvement.

In order to deliver on the best-in-class developer experience we promised, we've decided to delay Astro's release by a month. We'll be using this period to:

- Invest in even more out-of-the-box performance optimizations
- Improve error handling in our compiler
- Deliver dev server improvements like better HMR and more accurate stacktraces
- Resolve incoming bug reports as quickly as possible
