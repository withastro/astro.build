Astro makes it easy to build lightweight websites fast, but that's only one piece of the puzzle. With our growing catalog of [Themes](https://astro.build/themes) and [Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations), starting your next Astro project will be easier than ever!

## Themes

Looking to jumpstart your next project? Check out the [growing list of themes](https://astro.build/themes) built by our amazing community!

Interested in sharing your hard work? [Add your own starter project](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/issues/new/choose) to our themes catalog! We can't wait to see what our passionate community comes up with, 

<Note title="Coming Soon">
Sell your own themes! Once Astro 1.0 is released we plan to add support for paid themes sold on your own site.
</Note>

## Integrations

The [recently announced](https://astro.build/blog/astro-025/#new-astro-integrations) Integrations API makes it possible to bring your own frameworks, CSS tools, and packages into Astro with just a few keystrokes.

Our searchable [Integrations catalog](https://astro.build/integrations) makes finding the right integrations for your next project a breeze. As Astro closes in on a 1.0 release we look forward to seeing the list of third-party and community integrations grow!

Curious to learn more about the API? Head over to our [docs site](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) to build your next integration. Make sure to checkout the [publish to NPM](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/publish-to-npm/#integrations-library) section to learn more about how our catalog automatically pulls packages from NPM!
