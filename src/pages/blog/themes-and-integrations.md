Astro makes it easy to build lightweight websites fast - and with our growing catalog of [Themes](https://astro.build/themes) and [Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations), starting your next project is getting even easier!

## Themes

Looking to jumpstart your next project? Check out the [growing list of themes](https://astro.build/themes) built by our amazing community!

Interested in sharing your hard work? [Add your own starter project](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/issues/new/choose) to our themes catalog. We can't wait to see what you come up with! 

<Note title="Coming Soon - Paid Themes">
After the Astro 1.0 release, we plan to add support for the inclusion of paid themes to help you reach more potential customers and get compensated for the awesome stuff you create.
</Note>

## Integrations

Our [recently announced](https://astro.build/blog/astro-025/#new-astro-integrations) Integrations API makes it possible to bring your own frameworks, CSS tools, and packages into Astro with just a few clicks - and the searchable [Integrations catalog](https://astro.build/integrations) is designed to make finding the right integrations for your next project a breeze.

This is just the beginning, and we look forward to seeing the list of third-party and community-built integrations grow as we close in on our 1.0 release!

Curious to learn more about the API? Head over to our [docs site](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) to build your next integration, and make sure to checkout the [publish to NPM](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/publish-to-npm/#integrations-library) section to learn more about how our catalog automatically pulls packages from NPM!
