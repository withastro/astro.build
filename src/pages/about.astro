        <section>
            <p><strong>Astro</strong> helps web developers build better websites in less time. Astro is an MIT-licensed, open source build tool that combines a modern developer experience with efficient, lightweight output. The end result? Beautiful websites that work great on any device, across any internet connection.</p>

            <p>Astro launched 2021 and revolutionized web performance by integrating <strong>partial hydration</strong> -- a previously difficult-to-setup technology -- directly into the Astro runtime with built-in support for popular frameworks React, Svelte, Vue, and Solid.js.</p>

            <p>In less than a year, Astro amassed a huge community of contributors and an even larger audience of 10,000+ users at companies like Google, Netlify, Trivago and more. Astro won the <a href="https://jamstackconf.com/jammies/">"Ecosystem Innovation Award"</a> at last year's JamstackConf.</p>
