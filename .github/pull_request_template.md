## Browser Test Checklist

<!--
Test on as many of these browsers as you can, ideally 3+ of them.

Tests for all browsers are **strongly recommended** if this PR includes:

- Large gradients or the usage of `mask-image`, which can cause perf issues on Firefox Android (https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/pull/780)
- Font changes, which can behave strangely on Safari (https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/pull/1028)
- Adding SVGs, which can behave strangely on Safari (https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/pull/769)
-->

I have tested this PR on at least three of the following browsers:

- [ ] Chrome / Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Android Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] iOS Safari
